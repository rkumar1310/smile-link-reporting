# Section 1: Disclaimer

This report is generated based on your questionnaire responses and is for informational purposes only. It does not constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations.

**Important:** A clinical examination is required before any treatment can be recommended or provided. Do not make treatment decisions based solely on this report.

Treatment outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty. Results vary between patients and depend on factors that can only be assessed through clinical examination. Your dentist will provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.

## Your Personal Summary

John, you have one missing tooth in the area, affecting both appearance and function. Your focus is addressing a long-term gap from missing teeth.

*[24 words]*

## Context

# First-Time Treatment Context

This is your first dental treatment of this type. The information below covers what each option involves and typical experiences.

# Functional vs Aesthetic Priorities

Your situation involves both functional and aesthetic considerations. Treatment options may address these aspects differently, and understanding how each option balances function and appearance helps inform your decision.

Your dentist will explain how different treatments address both the functional and aesthetic aspects of your dental needs.

# Current Tooth Status

The current condition of your teeth influences which treatment options are most suitable. Factors like tooth structure, existing restorations, and overall oral health all play a role in planning.

Your dentist will assess your current tooth status and explain how this shapes the recommended treatment approach.

# Balanced Approach

Based on your preferences, you value multiple factors in your treatment decision—function, appearance, comfort, and cost all play a role. Finding the right balance between these considerations is the goal.

Your dentist will discuss options that balance these different priorities and explain how each option addresses your various concerns.

This area is visible during conversation and affects both aesthetics and chewing. Your surrounding teeth are stable, which means both treatment options are suitable for you.

## Interpretation

# Section 4: Interpretation

John, your situation has established treatment options. Both approaches are suitable for your case.

Your priorities (addressing a long-term gap from missing teeth) will help determine which option aligns with your goals. Your dentist will examine your specific situation to confirm clinical suitability.

## Treatment Options

**What this involves**
A titanium post is placed into the jawbone. After healing (3-6 months), a custom crown attaches to it. The result functions like a natural tooth.

**Outcomes**
Studies show implants remain functional and stable in approximately 90-95% of cases over 10 years. Your individual outcome depends on bone quality, oral hygiene, and overall health—factors your dentist will assess.

**Benefits**
- Does not modify neighboring teeth
- Helps preserve bone structure
- No special maintenance once healed

**Considerations**
- Higher upfront cost
- Healing period of 3-6 months
- Multiple appointments required

**This option may suit you if:**
- You prioritize long-term durability
- Preserving healthy adjacent teeth is important
- Bone quality is adequate (dentist will assess)

**What this involves**
A replacement tooth bonds to the back of adjacent teeth. No surgical procedure is required.

**Outcomes**
Results are typically immediate and natural-looking. The appearance depends on the health and color of adjacent teeth, which your dentist will assess.

**Benefits**
- Shorter treatment time (2-4 weeks)
- Usually lower upfront cost
- No surgery required
- Minimal impact on daily life

**Considerations**
- May need replacement after 10-15 years
- Relies on adjacent teeth for support
- Not suitable for every case

**This option may suit you if:**
- You prefer a non-surgical approach
- A faster timeline is important
- Surgery is not possible or advised

## Comparison

# Section 6: Comparison

## Implant vs. Bridge

| Factor | Dental Implant | Dental Bridge |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Adjacent teeth** | Not affected | Must be prepared |
| **Bone preservation** | Stimulates bone | Does not prevent bone loss |
| **Procedure** | Surgical | Non-surgical |
| **Treatment time** | 3-6 months | 2-4 weeks |
| **Initial cost** | Higher | Lower |
| **Expected lifespan*** | Typically 15-25+ years | Typically 10-15 years |
| **Maintenance** | Standard hygiene | Special cleaning required |

*Lifespans are population averages from studies. Your actual lifespan depends on bone quality, oral hygiene, and health factors. Individual outcomes vary.

Both implants and bridges are proven approaches. Here's what each offers:

**Implants may suit you if:**
- You prefer a self-supporting option
- Long-term durability is a priority
- You're comfortable with a surgical approach

**Bridges may suit you if:**
- You prefer a non-surgical approach
- You want faster results (2-4 weeks)
- A simpler process appeals to you

Your dentist will assess clinical factors; you decide which aligns with your priorities.

## Trade-offs to Consider

Both options typically provide natural-looking, functional results. Success depends on bone quality, adjacent tooth health, and oral care—factors your dentist will assess.

**Trade-offs:**
- **Timeline:** Bridges take 2-4 weeks; implants take 3-6 months
- **Procedure type:** Bridges are non-surgical; implants require minor surgery
- **Adjacent teeth:** Bridges use them for support; implants are self-supporting
- **Typical lifespan:** Bridges last 10-15 years; implants last 15-25+ years

*[61 words]*

## Treatment Process

**Implant with crown:** 3-7 months total
- Initial placement: 1-2 hours
- Healing period: 3-6 months
- Crown placement: separate appointment

**Adhesive bridge:** 2-4 weeks
- Preparation and fitting over 2-3 appointments

Your dentist will provide a timeline specific to your situation after examination.

*[40 words]*

## Cost Considerations

# Budget Considerations

You indicated flexibility when quality matters. Both options are available at different price points. Your dentist can provide specific costs based on your clinical situation.

- Single implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500
- Adhesive bridge: approximately €1,500 – €2,500

Costs vary by location, materials, and complexity. Your dentist can provide a detailed estimate.

*[53 words]*

## Risk Factors

**Implant with crown**
- Recovery: 2-5 days of mild to moderate tenderness, managed with over-the-counter medication.
- Risks: Infection (2-5%), implant failure (5-10% over 10 years). Your individual risk depends on bone quality, oral hygiene, and health factors your dentist will assess.
- Daily life: Most people resume normal activities within a few days.
- Long-term: Standard dental care once healed.

**Adhesive bridge**
- Recovery: None required—adjustment period of 1-2 days.
- Daily life: No limitation.
- Long-term: Periodic check-ups recommended.
