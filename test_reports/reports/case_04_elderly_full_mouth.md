# Section 1: Disclaimer

This report is generated based on your questionnaire responses and is for informational purposes only. It does not constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations.

**Important:** A clinical examination is required before any treatment can be recommended or provided. Do not make treatment decisions based solely on this report.

## Context

# First-Time Treatment Context

This is your first dental treatment of this type. Your dentist will explain the process step by step.

# Age Considerations

Your life stage provides context for treatment decisions. Factors like how long you want a solution to last, changes in your body's healing capacity, and your lifestyle all connect to age-appropriate treatment planning.

Your dentist will explain how these considerations factor into the recommendations for your situation.

# Functional vs Aesthetic Priorities

The relationship between function and aesthetics varies depending on your specific situation. Some treatments excel in one area, while others balance both. Understanding these trade-offs helps with decision-making.

Your dentist will discuss how each option performs in terms of function and appearance, helping you see how different choices align with your priorities.

# Function-Focused Approach

Your emphasis on function shapes how treatment options are evaluated. Different approaches restore function to different degrees and in different ways.

Your dentist will help you understand how each option performs functionally and what this means for your daily life.

Loose or painful teeth often cause uncertainty, especially during chewing or daily activities like eating and brushing.

In this scenario, the focus is functional confidence rather than aesthetics. The question is: how to restore a stable, comfortable feeling? Because looseness and pain can have different causes, careful assessment is important.
