This report is generated based on your questionnaire responses and is for informational purposes only. It does not constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations.

**Important:** A clinical examination is required before any treatment can be recommended or provided. Do not make treatment decisions based solely on this report.

Treatment outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty. Results vary between patients and depend on factors that can only be assessed through clinical examination. Your dentist will provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.

## Your Personal Summary

# Before We Begin

This report gives you the information you need to make a confident choice. Both treatment approaches are proven and reliable, and your dentist will support you through whichever process you choose.

Lisa, you have one missing tooth in the chewing area. Your focus is addressing a long-term gap from missing teeth, and two proven treatment options exist for your situation.

*[63 words]*

## Context

# First-Time Treatment Context

This is your first dental treatment of this type. The information below covers what each option involves and typical experiences.

# Functional vs Aesthetic Priorities

Modern dental treatments are designed to address both function and aesthetics. There are established options that reliably achieve good results in both areas.

Your dentist will present proven solutions that can meet your functional requirements while delivering aesthetic results appropriate for your situation.

# Current Tooth Status

Your tooth condition has been assessed and there are established treatment approaches for situations like yours. Modern dentistry has well-defined protocols for various states of tooth health.

Your dentist will explain the standard approaches appropriate for your tooth status and what outcomes you can reliably expect.

# Balanced Approach

Balanced treatment planning is standard practice in dentistry. There are established options that perform well across multiple dimensions—function, aesthetics, comfort, and value.

Your dentist will present options that offer good overall performance across the factors you care about.

A missing tooth in the chewing area affects both function and appearance. Your surrounding teeth are healthy and stable, which means both treatment options are suitable for you.

## Interpretation

# Section 4: Interpretation

Lisa, your situation has established treatment options. Both approaches are suitable for you.

Your priorities (addressing a long-term gap from missing teeth) will help determine which option feels right. Your dentist will examine your specific situation to confirm clinical suitability.

## Treatment Options

**What this involves**
A titanium post is placed into the jawbone. After healing (3-6 months), a custom crown attaches to it. The result functions like a natural tooth.

**Outcomes**
Studies show implants remain functional and stable in approximately 90-95% of cases over 10 years. Your individual outcome depends on bone quality, oral hygiene, and overall health—factors your dentist will assess.

**Benefits**
- Does not affect neighboring teeth
- Helps preserve bone structure
- No special maintenance once healed

**Process**
- Healing takes 3-6 months
- Recovery involves 2-5 days of mild to moderate tenderness, managed with over-the-counter pain relief
- Most patients return to normal activities within a few days

**Characteristics:**
Long-lasting (typically 15-25+ years), self-supporting, independent of adjacent teeth.

**What this involves**
A replacement tooth bonds to the back of adjacent teeth. No surgical procedure is required.

**Outcomes**
Results are typically immediate and natural-looking. The appearance depends on the health and color of adjacent teeth, which your dentist will assess.

**Benefits**
- No surgery or recovery period
- Immediate results
- Proven technique for single-tooth replacement

**Considerations**
- May need replacement after 10-15 years
- Relies on adjacent teeth for support
- Suitability depends on adjacent tooth condition

**Characteristics:**
Non-surgical, faster completion, relies on adjacent teeth.

## Comparison

# Section 6: Comparison

## Implant vs. Bridge

| Factor | Dental Implant | Dental Bridge |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Adjacent teeth** | Not involved | Used for support |
| **Bone health** | Maintained through use | May gradually decrease |
| **Procedure** | Surgical placement | Non-surgical |
| **Treatment time** | 3-6 months | 2-4 weeks |
| **Initial cost** | Higher upfront | More affordable initially |
| **Expected lifespan*** | Typically 15-25+ years | Typically 10-15 years |
| **Care routine** | Same as natural teeth | Special cleaning technique |

*Lifespans are population averages from studies. Your actual lifespan depends on bone quality, oral hygiene, and health factors. Individual outcomes vary.

Both implants and bridges are proven approaches. Here's what each offers:

**Implants may suit you if:**
- You prefer a self-supporting option
- Long-term durability is a priority
- You're comfortable with a surgical approach

**Bridges may suit you if:**
- You prefer a non-surgical approach
- You want faster results (2-4 weeks)
- A simpler process appeals to you

Your dentist will assess clinical factors; you decide which aligns with your priorities.

## Trade-offs to Consider

Both options typically provide natural-looking, comfortable results. Success depends on bone quality, adjacent tooth health, and your oral care—factors your dentist will assess.

**Trade-offs:**
- **Timeline:** Bridges take 2-4 weeks; implants take 3-7 months
- **Procedure type:** Bridges are non-surgical; implants require minor surgery
- **Adjacent teeth:** Bridges use them for support; implants are self-supporting
- **Typical lifespan:** Bridges last 10-15 years; implants last 15-25+ years

*[62 words]*

## Treatment Process

**Implant with crown:** 3-7 months total
- Initial placement: 1-2 hours
- Healing period: 3-6 months
- Crown placement: separate appointment

**Adhesive bridge:** 2-4 weeks
- Preparation and fitting over 2-3 appointments

Your dentist will provide a timeline specific to your situation after examination.

## Cost Considerations

# Budget Considerations

You indicated flexibility when quality matters. Both options are available at different price points. Your dentist can provide specific costs based on your clinical situation.

- Single implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500
- Adhesive bridge: approximately €1,500 – €2,500

Costs vary by location, materials, and complexity. Your dentist can discuss what's included and payment options.

## Risk Factors

**Implant with crown**
- Recovery: 2-5 days of mild to moderate tenderness. Most people manage this with over-the-counter pain relief and return to normal activities quickly.
- Risks: Infection occurs in 2-5% of cases and can be treated with antibiotics. Implant failure occurs in approximately 5-10% of cases over 10 years. Your dentist will discuss your individual risk factors and prevention strategies.
- Long-term: Standard dental care once healed.

**Adhesive bridge**
- Recovery: None required—immediate return to normal activities.
- Long-term: Periodic check-ups recommended.
