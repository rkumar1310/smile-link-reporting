## Important Notices

# Conditional: Bruxism Consideration

**Your teeth grinding habit affects treatment recommendations.**

Bruxism (teeth grinding) puts additional stress on dental work. Your dentist will consider this when recommending materials and may suggest protective measures like a night guard.

Treatment can proceed, but choices may be adjusted to account for the additional forces involved.

# Section 1: Disclaimer

This report is generated based on your questionnaire responses and is for informational purposes only. It does not constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations.

**Important:** A clinical examination is required before any treatment can be recommended or provided. Do not make treatment decisions based solely on this report.

Treatment outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty. Results vary between patients and depend on factors that can only be assessed through clinical examination. Your dentist will provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.

## Your Personal Summary

You're missing several teeth in different areas of your mouth, a situation that affects how you chew and may influence how you feel about your smile. This scattered pattern of tooth loss is common and can be addressed in different ways. Treatment options range from individual implants for each missing tooth to bridge solutions that restore multiple teeth per zone. Each approach has different implications for cost, treatment time, and long-term maintenance. What you choose to do, how you prioritize different areas, and whether to address everything at once or in stages—these are all personal decisions that depend on your circumstances, preferences, and goals.

## Context

# Smoking Consideration

You've indicated regular smoking. This is clinically relevant.

**Key points:**
- Healing typically takes longer
- Implant success rates may be 10-20% lower than for non-smokers in population studies
- Your dentist will assess how this affects your options

**Recovery considerations:**
- Extended healing periods are common
- More frequent follow-up is typically recommended
- Individual outcomes vary significantly

Your dentist can discuss specific implications for your situation.

# First-Time Treatment Context

This is your first dental treatment of this type. The information below covers what each option involves and typical experiences.

# Functional vs Aesthetic Priorities

How you balance function and aesthetics is your choice. Different options weight these aspects differently, giving you control over what matters most in your treatment.

Your dentist will explain how each option addresses function and appearance. You decide which balance reflects your personal priorities.

# Current Tooth Status

Your current tooth condition determines what options are available to you. Understanding your situation helps you participate meaningfully in treatment decisions.

Your dentist will explain your tooth status and what it means for your choices. You can then decide which treatment direction aligns with your goals.

# Function-Focused Approach

Your functional priorities guide the treatment options presented. Different approaches have different functional capabilities, and you can choose based on what level of function you need.

Your dentist will explain how each option performs functionally. You decide which approach best meets your functional needs.

Scattered tooth loss affects chewing in multiple areas simultaneously. You may have adapted to this situation, or you may find it limiting. Both experiences are valid.

The complexity of multiple gaps means there's no single obvious solution. Treatment typically involves decisions about which areas to address and in what order. These are personal decisions that depend on your priorities.

A dental professional can help you understand the implications of different approaches, but the choice of what to pursue remains yours.

Each missing tooth is replaced individually with an implant and crown.

**What this offers you**
- Maximum flexibility
- Independent function per tooth
- Ability to stage treatment as you choose

**What to consider**
- Multiple procedures required
- Higher total cost
- Longer overall process

**You might choose this if...**
You want individualized treatment and can accommodate the time and cost involved.

**What this involves**
Multiple missing teeth in a zone are replaced with a bridge on implants.

**What this offers you**
- More efficient treatment per zone
- Fewer procedures overall
- Potentially lower cost

**What to consider**
- Less individual treatment per tooth
- Less flexible for future changes
- Requires adequate bone per zone

**You might choose this if...**
You prefer a more streamlined approach to restoring each area.
