  "overall_score": 5.5,
  "dimensions": {
    "professional_quality": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "Severely verbose with excessive filler phrases. The phrase 'Based on the information provided...' appears 4 times as pure padding. Repetitive structure across sections wastes words. Many sentences use 10 words where 5 would suffice. Generic transitions add no value."
    },
    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Disclaimers present but weak. Section 1 is adequate but subsequent sections lack appropriate hedging. Treatment outcome language is too casual ('can restore functional chewing') without sufficient caveats. Risk discussion is superficial and doesn't adequately convey uncertainty."
    },
    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Tone is inconsistent. Some sections maintain autonomy-respecting voice well, but others slip into generic professional language that doesn't match TP-06. Section 4 particularly fails with corporate speak. Autonomy emphasis becomes repetitive rather than natural."
    },
    "personalization": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Minimal personalization despite available patient data. Patient name 'James' never used. Specific situation (2-4 non-adjacent teeth, both arches, functional priority) barely referenced. Content reads generic and could apply to many patients. Missed opportunities to reference his durability focus and 6-month timeline."
    },
    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Autonomy is emphasized but becomes heavy-handed and repetitive, especially in Section 11. Some subtle directive language present. The constant emphasis on choice paradoxically feels like being told how to feel about having choices rather than naturally presenting options."
    },
    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Structure is mostly complete with all required sections present. Logical flow is reasonable. However, Section 7 is underdeveloped at only 24 words, and there's significant redundancy with smoking content appearing in both Sections 3 and 10. Section 6 appears to be missing entirely."
