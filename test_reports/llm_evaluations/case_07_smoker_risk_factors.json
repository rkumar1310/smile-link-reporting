    "professional_quality": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "The writing is plagued by verbose filler phrases and repetitive content. 'Based on the information provided...' appears THREE times as pure padding. Multiple sections repeat the same smoking information verbatim. Transitions waste words without adding value. Sentences are often wordy when they could be direct. The report feels padded rather than purposeful."
    },
    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Disclaimers are present but weak. Section 1 is adequate but generic. The report makes soft claims about outcomes ('can restore functional chewing') without sufficient hedging. Risk disclosure for smoking is repetitive but lacks depth about actual failure rates or complications. Missing clear statements about individual variation in outcomes."
    },
    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Tone is generally consistent with TP-06 autonomy-respecting approach. Good use of 'you might choose' and 'your decision' language. However, some sections slip into slightly directive phrasing. The repetition of autonomy statements becomes performative rather than genuine."
    },
    "personalization": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Minimal personalization despite patient name being provided. Generic content dominates. Patient's specific situation (2-4 non-adjacent teeth, both arches, functional priority, durability focus) barely referenced. Could apply to almost any multiple-tooth-loss patient. Section 4 is entirely generic placeholder text."
    },
    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "Strong autonomy emphasis throughout. Good use of non-directive language in options section. 'You might choose this if' framing is excellent. Section 11 reinforces patient control well. Minor issues with some passive constructions that imply dentist control rather than patient choice."
    },
    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "All required sections present. Logical flow from summary through options to next steps. However, Section 6 (Expected Results) is missing entirely - only Section 7 (Trade-offs) appears. Section 4 is too brief and generic. Some sections are redundant (smoking appears twice). Structure is complete but not optimized."

  "overall_assessment": "This report suffers from significant verbosity and redundancy issues that undermine its professionalism. The same filler phrase appears three times, smoking content is duplicated verbatim across sections, and generic placeholder text fills space without adding value. Clinical safety is adequate but needs stronger hedging and risk disclosure. Personalization is weak despite detailed patient data being available. The structure is complete but unoptimized, with Section 6 missing entirely. Most critically, the content needs to be cut by 20-30% to remove padding and improve clarity. Scores reflect harsh but fair assessment - this is mediocre content that requires substantial revision to meet professional standards.",
