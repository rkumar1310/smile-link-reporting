  "overall_score": 4.7,
  "dimensions": {
    "professional_quality": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Writing is generally clear but suffers from significant verbosity and filler language. Multiple sections contain redundant phrasing, unnecessary transitions, and padding that dilutes impact. Sentences often say the same thing multiple times across different sections. The report could be 30-40% shorter without losing essential information."
    },
    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Disclaimer is present and appropriately cautious. However, clinical safety messaging is undermined by weak hedging in some areas and insufficient emphasis on smoking's impact. The report appropriately avoids guarantees but could be more explicit about outcome variability and the limitations of population-level statistics."
    },
    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "Tone is inconsistent and often shifts between clinical detachment and forced empathy. The autonomy-respecting tone (TP-06) is attempted but executed poorly through repetitive, heavy-handed autonomy messaging that feels patronizing rather than genuinely respectful. Clinical sections feel cold and impersonal, while personalization attempts feel generic and disconnected."
    },
    "personalization": {
      "score": 3,
      "feedback": "Personalization is severely lacking. While the report references James by name once, it fails to meaningfully incorporate his specific profile, priorities, or situation. Content reads as generic template text that could apply to any patient with multiple missing teeth. Patient's specific characteristics (first-timer, functional priority, smoking, balanced budget, durability focus, short-term horizon) are barely reflected in treatment recommendations or framing."
    },
    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "Patient autonomy is theoretically emphasized but executed through repetitive, heavy-handed messaging that paradoxically undermines genuine autonomy. The constant reminders that 'these are personal decisions' and 'the choice remains yours' feel patronizing and suggest the patient needs repeated reassurance. Subtle directive language appears in option framing ('You might choose this if...'), and some sections present information in ways that could bias toward certain options."
    },
    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Report includes required sections and follows logical flow from disclaimer through next steps. However, several sections are inadequately developed (Section 4 is only 45 words, Section 7 is only 29 words) and some content is redundantly placed. Section 6 (Expectations) appears to be missing entirely. The structure is present but execution is uneven, with critical sections underdeveloped."

  "overall_assessment": "This report is mediocre (5-6 range) with significant structural and content issues that undermine its effectiveness. The most critical problems are: severe verbosity with repetitive autonomy messaging that becomes patronizing, complete duplication of smoking section, inadequately developed critical sections (Trade-offs is only 29 words, Interpretation is 45 words), and poor personalization despite having detailed patient profile data. Clinical safety is adequate but could be stronger on complications and outcome variability. The autonomy-respecting tone is attempted but executed poorly through heavy-handed repetition rather than genuine respect. Immediate priorities: eliminate duplication, expand underdeveloped sections, reduce repetitive messaging, and meaningfully personalize content to James's specific profile and priorities.",
