    "professional_quality": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Writing quality is inconsistent with significant verbosity issues. Multiple sections contain filler phrases and redundant statements that pad content without adding value. Some sections are tight and effective, but others meander. The report says in 1024 words what could be communicated in 700-800."
    },
    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Safety disclaimers are present and generally appropriate, but some treatment descriptions lack sufficient hedging about outcomes. The pregnancy warning is prominent and appropriate. Risk percentages are provided but could use more context about individual variation."
    },
    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Tone is inconsistent across sections. Some sections achieve the reflective, contextual tone well (Sections 2, 3), while others revert to generic clinical language (Sections 4, 6, 11). The thoughtful framing is present but not sustained throughout."
    },
    "personalization": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "Personalization is weak throughout. Emma's name appears only in the header. Her specific situation (pregnancy, front tooth, first-timer, exploring stage, natural aesthetic preference) is barely referenced. Most content is generic and could apply to any single missing tooth case."
    },
    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "Autonomy is generally well-respected with non-directive language throughout. Options are presented neutrally without pushing toward specific choices. However, some subtle framing issues exist, and the 'often resonates with people who' structure could be more neutral."
    },
    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Structure is complete with all required sections present and generally logical flow. However, Section 4 is underdeveloped, Section 7 is redundant with Section 5, and the pregnancy warning placement could be better integrated."

  "overall_assessment": "This report demonstrates moderate quality with significant room for improvement. The main weaknesses are verbosity (particularly Sections 3, 5, 7), poor personalization (Emma's specific situation barely referenced), and inconsistent tone (shifts from reflective to generic clinical). Section 7 is largely redundant and Section 4 is underdeveloped. Clinical safety is acceptable but needs stronger hedging in outcome statements. The structure is complete but could be streamlined. Most critically, the report reads as generic template content rather than a thoughtful analysis of Emma's specific situation as a pregnant first-timer seeking natural aesthetics for a front tooth.",
