  "dimensions": {
    "professional_quality": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Writing is generally clear but suffers from significant verbosity and filler language. Many sentences could be tightened, and several paragraphs repeat ideas unnecessarily. The reflective tone sometimes masks lack of substance with flowery language that doesn't add clinical value."
    },
    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Disclaimers are present and reasonably comprehensive, but language around outcomes and risks could be more cautious. Risk percentages are provided but lack sufficient hedging about individual variation. Pregnancy warning is appropriate but could be more explicit about treatment postponement."
    },
    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Tone shifts inconsistently between reflective-contextual and clinical-factual. Some sections are overly philosophical ('deeper desire for stability') while others are purely informational. The reflective tone sometimes feels forced or patronizing rather than genuinely thoughtful. Doesn't consistently match TP-03 criteria of 'thoughtful framing of options.'"
    },
    "personalization": {
      "score": 3,
      "feedback": "Severely lacking personalization. Content is almost entirely generic and could apply to any patient with a single missing tooth. Patient name 'Emma' appears nowhere in the report. No references to her specific answers: pregnancy status, first-timer anxiety, aesthetic priorities, or flexible budget approach. Reflective sections use generic observations rather than addressing her unique situation."
    },
    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Generally respects patient choice and avoids directive language, but contains subtle bias toward implants and some implicit pressure. Language like 'This approach often resonates with people who...' frames options as personality types rather than neutral choices. Autonomy statements are present but could be stronger and more explicit about genuine equipoise."
    },
    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Structure is logical and complete with all required sections present in appropriate order. Sections flow reasonably well from warning through options to next steps. However, some sections are disproportionately long (Section 5 at 251 words) while others are too brief (Section 4 at 28 words). Section 3 combines two content sources awkwardly. Overall organization is sound but could be tightened."

These aren't just practical questions—they often reflect a deeper desire for stability and predictability.",
