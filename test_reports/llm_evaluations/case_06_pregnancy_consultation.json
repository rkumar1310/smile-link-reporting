  "dimensions": {
    "professional_quality": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "The writing is verbose and repetitive, with excessive filler phrases that dilute the message. Multiple sections begin with 'Based on the information provided...' which adds no value. The report uses padding language throughout ('It's interesting that...', 'What's worth noting...') that makes it feel bloated. Sentences are often unnecessarily long and could be tightened significantly. The tone shifts between clinical and conversational awkwardly."
    },
    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "The disclaimer in Section 1 is adequate but could be stronger. Section 0 pregnancy warning is appropriately cautious. However, several sections make claims that need more hedging. Section 5 states implants 'often' last decades without proper qualification about individual variation. Section 6 comparison table presents ranges as facts without sufficient caveats. The report lacks consistent reminders that outcomes vary significantly by individual."
    },
    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "The tone is inconsistent throughout. Section 3 attempts philosophical reflection ('deeper desire for stability') which feels forced for TP-03. Section 4 suddenly shifts to clinical/technical language ('falls within established treatment frameworks'). Section 5 tries conversational ('Worth reflecting on') but comes across as artificial. Section 6 is purely clinical with no contextual framing. The reflective-contextual tone should be more naturally integrated, not applied as a surface layer."
    },
    "personalization": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "The report is largely generic and could apply to almost any patient with a missing front tooth. Emma's name is never used despite being provided. Her specific priorities (natural/subtle aesthetics, very important natural look, pregnancy status, first-timer, exploring stage) are barely addressed. The pregnancy warning is isolated in Section 0 but never integrated into the treatment discussion. Her conservative aesthetic tolerance and balanced budget approach get minimal specific attention."
    },
    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "The report generally respects patient autonomy with good use of non-directive language. Section 11 is strong on patient control. However, there are subtle directive moments: Section 4 says 'professional assessment is the logical next step' (implies should), Section 5 uses 'This approach often resonates with people who...' which creates implicit pressure. The comparison section is appropriately neutral. Overall maintains autonomy well but has a few slips."
    },
    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "The report includes all required sections and follows a logical progression. Section 0 pregnancy warning is appropriately placed. The flow from personal summary through options to next steps makes sense. However, Section 2 is extremely brief (37 words) and doesn't adequately introduce the report. Section 4 'Interpretation' feels redundant with Section 2. The comparison table in Section 6 is well-structured. Cost information is appropriately placed. Overall structure is solid but some sections need better development."

  "overall_assessment": "This report suffers from significant verbosity and repetitive filler language that undermines professional quality. The same padding phrases appear multiple times, and philosophical language often replaces concrete information. Clinical safety is adequate but needs stronger hedging on outcome claims. Personalization is weak - the patient's name is never used and specific priorities are barely addressed. The structure is complete but several sections are underdeveloped. Most critically, the content needs to be tightened by 25-30% to remove filler and improve clarity.",
