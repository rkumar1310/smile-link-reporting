    "professional_quality": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "The writing is severely bloated with filler phrases and repetitive content. Nearly every section opens with 'Based on the information provided...' which adds zero value. The report uses 1229 words to convey what could be said in 600-700. Transitions are wordy, autonomy statements are repeated excessively, and many sentences pad simple facts with unnecessary preamble."
    },
    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Disclaimer is present but treatment language is too optimistic in places. Phrases like 'predictable result', 'proven technique', and 'well-established' appear without sufficient hedging. Risk section is too brief and doesn't adequately cover potential complications. Missing explicit statement that outcomes vary significantly between patients."
    },
    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Tone is generally reassuring and stability-focused as required for TP-04. However, some sections drift into overly warm/empathetic language that feels forced. The anxiety handling in Section 2 is appropriate, but similar reassurance patterns repeat too often in later sections, diluting impact."
    },
    "personalization": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Patient name (Lisa) is never used despite being provided. Generic content dominates - most sections could apply to any single-tooth case. Specific patient priorities (natural/subtle aesthetics, severe anxiety, first-timer status) are acknowledged but not woven throughout. The 'visible area' mention is good but underutilized."
    },
    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Autonomy is emphasized repeatedly but becomes preachy and repetitive. Section 2, Section 11, and scattered statements throughout all remind patient of their control. While non-directive, the excessive repetition of autonomy language feels like overcompensation and wastes space. Some option framing subtly favors implants."
    },
    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "All required sections present and in logical order. Flow is coherent. Section 4 (Interpretation) feels thin and could be merged or expanded. Section 7 (Trade-offs) is too brief at 39 words. Otherwise structure is solid with appropriate progression from context to options to next steps."

  "overall_assessment": "This report has solid structure and appropriate tone for an anxious first-timer, but suffers from severe verbosity and repetitive filler content. Clinical safety needs strengthening with better hedging and risk disclosure. Personalization is minimal despite available patient data. The 1229-word count could be cut to 700-800 words without losing substance by removing filler phrases, consolidating repetitive autonomy statements, and tightening wordy sections. Most critical issues: remove 'Based on the information provided' padding, strengthen outcome disclaimers, expand risk discussion beyond recovery, and use patient name for personalization.",
