  "dimensions": {
    "professional_quality": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Writing is generally clear but suffers from significant verbosity and repetitive patterns. Multiple sections contain filler phrases and padding that dilute the message. The report says the same things multiple times in different ways, particularly around reassurance and predictability. Transitions waste words without adding value."
    },
    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Disclaimer is present and comprehensive, but treatment descriptions contain subtle optimism that needs more hedging. Success rates are cited without sufficient context about individual variation. Risk disclosures are present but somewhat minimized. Language like 'predictable' and 'reliable' appears too frequently without adequate qualification."
    },
    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Tone generally matches TP-04 stability-frame with reassuring language throughout. Successfully emphasizes safety and predictability. However, some sections slip into generic empathy that feels forced rather than naturally reassuring. The anxiety-focused opening is appropriate but could be more concise."
    },
    "personalization": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "Report contains significant generic content that could apply to any patient. Lisa's name is used once but her specific situation (one missing tooth, side chewing area, severe anxiety, first-timer, exploring stage) is barely referenced. The content reads like a template with minimal customization. Patient priorities from intake are not explicitly connected to recommendations."
    },
    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Report generally avoids directive language and emphasizes patient choice. However, some subtle framing makes implants seem like the superior option. The comparison table structure and 'may suit you if' sections are good for autonomy, but some statements imply preference. Repeated reassurance about 'no pressure' is good but becomes redundant."
    },
    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "Report includes all required sections in logical order. Structure follows a clear progression from context through options to next steps. Section lengths are generally appropriate. Flow is logical. Minor issues with some sections being too brief (Section 4, Section 8) and others too verbose (Section 3)."

  "overall_assessment": "This report demonstrates adequate structure and appropriate tone for an anxious patient, but suffers from significant verbosity, generic content, and insufficient personalization. The writing contains substantial padding and repetitive reassurance that dilutes the message. A critical factual error about tooth location undermines credibility. Clinical safety disclaimers are present but some outcome statements need stronger hedging. The report would benefit from cutting 20-30% of words, correcting factual errors, and adding specific connections to Lisa's stated priorities and situation. Score: 5.8/10 overall - mediocre quality requiring substantial revision.",
