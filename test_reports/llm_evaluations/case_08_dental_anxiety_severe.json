  "dimensions": {
    "professional_quality": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "Writing is verbose and repetitive throughout. Multiple sections contain filler phrases and redundant statements that add no value. Generic transitions waste words. Many sentences could be cut in half without losing meaning. The report feels padded rather than concise and professional."
    },
    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Disclaimers are present but could be stronger. Some outcome language is too optimistic without sufficient hedging. Risk percentages are provided but lack context about individual variation. The anxiety notice is good but the report doesn't consistently maintain cautious language throughout."
    },
    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Tone is inconsistent. Some sections use reassuring stability-frame language appropriate for severe anxiety (TP-04), but other sections are generic and don't maintain the reassuring emphasis. The anxiety notice is good but the report doesn't consistently deliver on 'emphasizes safety and predictability' throughout."
    },
    "personalization": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Report uses patient name (Lisa) but most content is generic and could apply to anyone with a missing tooth. Specific patient priorities (long-term gap, severe anxiety, conservative aesthetic tolerance, first-timer) are mentioned but not deeply integrated into recommendations. The severe anxiety is addressed in Section 0 but not woven throughout."
    },
    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Report generally respects patient autonomy with non-directive language. Good use of 'may suit you if' framing in Section 6. However, some subtle directive language appears, and the autonomy emphasis becomes repetitive rather than genuinely empowering."
    },
    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "All required sections are present and in logical order. Structure follows expected flow from disclaimer through options to next steps. However, some sections are too brief (Section 4) while others are bloated with generic content (Section 3). Section 0 anxiety notice is well-placed but creates slight redundancy with later content."

  "overall_assessment": "This report has correct structure and covers required content, but suffers from significant verbosity and generic filler throughout. Section 3's 187 words of generic modules add almost no value. The severe anxiety tone (TP-04) is inconsistent - strong in Section 0 but generic/clinical in most other sections. Personalization is superficial despite good patient data. Clinical safety is adequate but could be stronger with more hedging and individual variation emphasis. Cut 30-40% of words, strengthen anxiety-appropriate tone throughout, and integrate patient-specific details more deeply.",
