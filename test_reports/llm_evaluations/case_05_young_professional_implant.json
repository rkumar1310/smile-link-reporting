  "dimensions": {
    "professional_quality": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Writing is generally clear but suffers from significant verbosity and filler language. Multiple sections contain redundant phrases and padding that dilutes the message. Transitions are often unnecessary. Some sections are too brief while others are wordy without adding value."
    },
    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Disclaimer is comprehensive and appropriately cautious. Language generally avoids guarantees. However, some statements could be more carefully hedged, and risk disclosures in Section 10 are somewhat superficial."
    },
    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "Tone is consistently autonomy-respecting throughout most sections. Language emphasizes choice and avoids directive statements. Minor lapses where language becomes slightly prescriptive."
    },
    "personalization": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "Content is largely generic and could apply to almost any patient with a missing tooth. Patient name Sarah is never used. Specific priorities mentioned in profile (durability-focused, premium budget, short timeline) are barely referenced. Feels cookie-cutter."
    },
    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Generally respects patient autonomy with non-directive language. However, some subtle framing issues and the 'You might choose this if...' structure creates implicit guidance toward certain options."
    },
    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "All required sections present but several are underdeveloped. Section lengths are inconsistent - some critical sections are too brief while less important ones are verbose. Logical flow is acceptable but some sections feel out of place."

The writing is verbose with filler language, several critical sections are severely underdeveloped (Sections 4, 7, 8), and personalization is minimal despite detailed patient information being available. Clinical safety is acceptable but could be stronger. The tone appropriately respects autonomy but some framing is subtly directive. Most critically, the report feels generic and cookie-cutter rather than tailored to Sarah's specific situation and priorities.",
