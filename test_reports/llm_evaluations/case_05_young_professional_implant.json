  "overall_score": 4.9,
  "dimensions": {
    "professional_quality": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Writing is generally clear but suffers from verbosity, repetition, and filler phrases that dilute impact. Multiple sections contain padding that could be eliminated without loss of meaning. Sentence structure is often awkward with unnecessary qualifications."
    },
    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Disclaimer is present and adequate, but clinical safety language is inconsistent. Some sections use appropriate hedging while others make claims that are too definitive. Risk disclosure is minimal and vague. Missing specific safety warnings about implant surgery complications."
    },
    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "Tone is inconsistent and frequently shifts from autonomy-respecting to subtly directive. Multiple sections contain language that guides toward implants or away from bridges, violating the TP-06 autonomy-respecting tone. Conversational elements feel forced and undermine clinical credibility."
    },
    "personalization": {
      "score": 3,
      "feedback": "Report is largely generic and could apply to any patient with a single missing back tooth. Patient name (Sarah) is never used. Specific patient priorities (durability-focused, premium budget, first-timer, comfort-oriented) are barely reflected. Content reads like a template with minimal customization."
    },
    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Report attempts to respect autonomy but undermines it through subtle directive framing, comparison table bias, and 'you might choose if' language that implies certain patient types should select certain options. Autonomy statements are repetitive rather than genuinely empowering. Missing genuine exploration of patient's actual decision-making process."
    },
    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Report includes all required sections in logical order, but several sections are underdeveloped or redundant. Section 4 (Interpretation) is largely redundant with Section 2. Section 7 (Trade-offs) is too brief and vague. Section 8 (Treatment Process) lacks detail. Overall structure is sound but execution is weak."

  "overall_assessment": "This report is mediocre and requires significant revision. While it includes required sections and attempts an autonomy-respecting tone, it suffers from verbosity, redundancy, subtle directive bias, and dangerously minimal risk disclosure. Section 4 is redundant and should be removed. Clinical safety language is weak, particularly regarding implant complications and failure rates. The report is generic and barely personalized to Sarah's specific priorities (durability, premium, first-timer, comfort). Multiple sections contain filler phrases and repetitive autonomy statements that undermine credibility. Section 6's comparison table subtly favors implants through framing bias. Sections 7, 8, and 10 are too brief and lack necessary detail. The report needs substantial tightening, personalization, and safety enhancement before it meets professional standards.",
