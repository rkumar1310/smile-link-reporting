  "dimensions": {
    "professional_quality": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "Excessive verbosity and filler language throughout. The phrase 'Based on the information provided...' appears THREE times in the first four sections - this is pure padding that adds zero value. Many sections use 10 words where 5 would suffice. Transitions are wordy and repetitive. The writing lacks crispness and directness."
    },
    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Disclaimer is present but weak. Language throughout is too casual about outcomes ('can restore comfortable chewing', 'Either can work well'). Missing specific risk disclosures for implant failure, bridge complications. Cost ranges presented without caveats about variability. Recovery information oversimplified."
    },
    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Generally maintains autonomy-respecting tone well. Good use of 'you choose', 'your decision', 'up to you' language. However, some sections slip into slightly directive framing, particularly in the comparison table and 'you might choose this if' statements. Tone is consistent but could be more neutral in places."
    },
    "personalization": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Minimal personalization despite available patient data. Patient name 'Sarah' not used anywhere. Specific situation (one missing back tooth, side chewing area, premium budget preference, durability focus) barely referenced. Content reads generic and could apply to any single-tooth case. Missed opportunities to connect to stated priorities."
    },
    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Autonomy emphasis is present but overdone to the point of being performative. The constant repetition of 'your choice', 'up to you', 'your decision' across multiple sections feels forced rather than genuine. Some subtle directive language remains in option presentations. The autonomy messaging would be stronger if stated once clearly rather than repeated constantly."
    },
    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "All required sections present and in logical order. Structure follows standard report format well. However, Section 7 (Trade-offs) is underdeveloped at only 29 words - too brief to be useful. Section 10 (Risk Factors) focuses only on recovery, missing actual risk discussion. Some sections could be better integrated rather than standing alone as fragments."

The phrase 'Based on the information provided' appears three times in four sections - pure padding. Clinical safety is compromised by overly optimistic language about outcomes and missing risk disclosures (implant failure rates, bridge complications). Personalization is weak despite available patient data - name never used, specific priorities not connected to options. Autonomy emphasis is overdone to the point of being performative, with repetitive statements across 5+ sections. Structure is complete but Section 7 is underdeveloped (29 words) and Section 10 misnamed. Content needs significant tightening, stronger safety language, and genuine personalization.
