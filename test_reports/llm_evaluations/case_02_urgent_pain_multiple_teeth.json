      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "The writing is severely bloated with filler phrases and repetitive content. Nearly every section opens with 'Based on the information provided...' which adds zero value. Transitions are wordy and padding is excessive throughout. The report says in 1184 words what could be said in 600-700."

    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Disclaimers are present but weak. The language is overly optimistic about outcomes ('reliable process,' 'high success rates') without adequate hedging. Risk disclosures are vague and incomplete. Missing important caveats about individual variation."

    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Tone is generally consistent with TP-04 (Stability-Frame) and maintains reassuring quality throughout. However, some sections drift toward generic empathy rather than specific reassurance. The anxiety acknowledgment is appropriate but could be more integrated."

      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Structure is mostly complete with all required sections present. However, Section 6 is suppressed without explanation, and some sections are too brief to be useful. The flow is logical but some sections feel disconnected."

The writing is bloated with filler phrases, repetitive reassurance, and generic content that could apply to anyone. Clinical safety is compromised by overly optimistic language and inadequate risk disclosure. While the tone is generally appropriate and structure is complete, the content needs 30-40% reduction in word count and significant strengthening of patient-specific elements. Most critically: remove all 'Based on the information provided' phrases, use Maria's name, connect to her specific priorities (functional, durable, affordable), expand inadequate sections (7, 8, 10), and add proper hedging to outcome claims.",
