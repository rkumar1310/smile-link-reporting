  "dimensions": {
    "professional_quality": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Writing is generally clear but suffers from significant verbosity and repetitive patterns. Multiple sections contain filler phrases and padding that dilute the message. The report says the same things multiple times in different ways, particularly around reassurance and patient autonomy. Transitions waste words without adding value."
    },
    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Disclaimers are present but could be stronger. Some language is overly optimistic about outcomes without sufficient hedging. Success rates are cited without enough context about individual variation. Risk disclosures exist but are somewhat buried and could be more prominent."
    },
    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Tone is generally consistent with TP-04 stability-frame approach. Reassuring language is present throughout and uncertainty is minimized appropriately for anxious patients. However, some sections feel slightly generic rather than fully calibrated to the severe anxiety profile."
    },
    "personalization": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Report includes some personalization (Maria's name, specific situation) but much content feels generic and could apply to any patient. Missing opportunities to reference her specific priorities around durability and function. Budget considerations are mentioned but not deeply integrated."
    },
    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Report generally respects patient autonomy with non-directive language. However, some subtle framing makes certain options seem preferable. The phrase 'Your dentist will guide you' appears too frequently, which could feel paternalistic rather than empowering."
    },
    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "Structure is logical and includes all required sections. Flow is generally good with clear progression from context to options to practical considerations. Section 6 is appropriately suppressed. Minor issues with section brevity and balance."
