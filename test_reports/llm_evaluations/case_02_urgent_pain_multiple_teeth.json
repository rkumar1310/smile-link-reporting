Some sections feel patronizing rather than genuinely reassuring."

Content is entirely generic and could apply to any patient with missing adjacent teeth. No reference to Maria's specific priorities (functional focus, budget constraints, anxiety level, first-time status). Treatment options are not tailored to her stated preferences. The report reads like a template with minimal customization."

      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "Patient autonomy is compromised by subtle directive language and framing that makes one option appear preferable. While the report attempts to present both options, language choices and emphasis patterns bias toward implants. The report uses 'consider' language and frames options in ways that suggest one is 'better' without explicitly stating this. Autonomy language is repetitive rather than genuinely empowering."

Section numbering is inconsistent (Section 5 appears twice, Section 6 is missing/suppressed). Logical flow is reasonable but some sections could be reordered.

While structurally complete, it suffers from excessive verbosity, insufficient personalization, and critical clinical safety problems including overstated success rates and inappropriate certainty language for an anxious patient. The report contains multiple instances of subtle bias toward implants, weak autonomy language, and generic content that could apply to any patient. Most critically, clinical claims lack adequate hedging and the tone doesn't consistently match the TP-04 Stability-Frame profile. Substantial revision is needed before this report is suitable for patient use.",
