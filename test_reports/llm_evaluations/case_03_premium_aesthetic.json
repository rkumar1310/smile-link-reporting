    "professional_quality": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Writing is generally clear but suffers from verbosity, repetitive phrasing, and filler language. Multiple sections contain padding that doesn't add value. Transitions are often wordy. Some awkward constructions present."
    },
    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Disclaimers are present and appropriately cautious. Language generally avoids guarantees. However, some statements could be more carefully hedged, and outcome uncertainty could be emphasized more consistently throughout."

    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Tone is generally expectation-calibrating but inconsistently applied. Some sections are appropriately realistic while others slip into more optimistic language. The balance between optimism and honest limitations wavers across sections."

    "personalization": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Report includes patient name and references specific questionnaire responses (previous treatment, premium budget, aesthetic goals). However, some sections feel generic and could better integrate Robert's specific situation and priorities."
    },
    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "Report generally respects patient autonomy well. Language is non-directive and emphasizes choice. However, a few subtle instances of framing could be more neutral."
    },
    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "All required sections present and in logical order. However, Section 6 (Expected Results) is missing entirely, and some sections are underdeveloped. Flow between sections could be smoother."

The writing is mediocre - clear enough but padded with phrases that don't add value. Clinical safety is acceptable but could be stronger. Personalization exists but feels surface-level. The missing Section 6 is a critical structural gap. Most concerning is the amount of generic boilerplate that could apply to any patient, reducing the report's usefulness for Robert specifically.",
