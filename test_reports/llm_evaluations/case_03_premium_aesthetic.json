    "professional_quality": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "The writing is plagued by verbose filler phrases and repetitive padding. 'Based on the information provided...' appears THREE times unnecessarily. Sections contain redundant statements and wordy transitions that add no value. The writing lacks tightness and precision expected in professional medical communication."
    },
    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Disclaimers exist but are weak and scattered. Section 1 disclaimer is generic boilerplate. Critical safety language is missing from treatment options - no mention of irreversibility of veneers, no discussion of potential complications. Risk section is superficial and downplays real concerns. Missing comprehensive informed consent language."
    },
    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Tone attempts expectation-calibration but inconsistently. Some sections are appropriately cautious (Section 4), others slip into promotional language (Section 9 'premium investment'). The balance between optimism and realism wavers. Missing the consistent realistic framing expected from TP-05."
    },
    "personalization": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Patient name 'Robert' is never used despite being provided. Content is largely generic and could apply to any aesthetic patient. Specific questionnaire responses (Q7: hollywood, Q8: hollywood_bright_white, Q10: premium) are barely reflected. The 'experienced' patient history (Q4: yes_veneers_crowns) is mentioned only generically in Section 3."
    },
    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Generally respects autonomy with non-directive language. Section 11 is excellent ('Your next steps are entirely up to you'). However, some subtle directive language appears in treatment options ('This may be logical for you if...') which implies judgment about what's appropriate. Overall maintains patient control but could be more consistently neutral."
    },
    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Most required sections present but Section 6 (Expectations/Timeline) is completely missing. Section numbering jumps from 5 to 7. Content is present but organization is illogical - timeline information scattered across sections 7, 8, and 10 rather than consolidated. Some sections are too brief (Section 7: 38 words, Section 8: 14 words)."
