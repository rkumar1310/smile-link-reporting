      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Writing is generally clear but contains significant verbosity and filler language that undermines professional quality. Multiple sentences waste words without adding value, and there are redundant explanations across sections. Transitions are often clunky and padding is evident throughout."
    },
    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Disclaimer is present and appropriately cautious, but clinical safety language is inconsistent throughout the report. Some sections use appropriate hedging while others make claims that are too confident. Risk disclosures exist but are scattered and could be more prominent. The report avoids guarantees but occasionally uses language that could mislead about outcomes."

    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Tone shifts noticeably between sections and doesn't consistently match the TP-05 expectation-calibration profile. Some sections are overly clinical and detached, while others attempt warmth but feel forced. The tone doesn't adequately balance optimism with realistic limitations as required by TP-05. There's inconsistency in how outcomes are discussed across sections."

    "personalization": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "Report is largely generic and could apply to almost any patient seeking aesthetic alignment treatment. Patient name (Robert) is never used. Specific patient priorities from questionnaire are barely referenced. Treatment options aren't tailored to Robert's stated preferences (Hollywood smile, aggressive aesthetic tolerance, premium budget, short-term timeline). Content reads like a template with minimal customization."

    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Report respects patient choice in structure but contains subtle directive language and framing bias. While not overtly coercive, the presentation of options isn't truly neutral. Some sections imply one option is better suited without explicitly stating this is Robert's choice. Language occasionally uses soft directives ('may be logical for you if...') that subtly guide rather than inform."

    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Report includes all required sections in logical order and is reasonably complete. Structure follows a sensible flow from disclaimer through options to next steps. However, some sections are underdeveloped (Section 4 is too brief and vague), while others are redundant (Risk Factors repeats information from Trade-offs). Section 6 (Expectations) appears to be missing entirely. Overall structure is adequate but could be tightened."

  "overall_assessment": "This report is mediocre and requires significant improvement. While it includes required sections and avoids critical safety violations, it suffers from substantial verbosity, poor personalization, and inconsistent tone. The report treats Robert as a generic patient despite having detailed intake information, never uses his name, and fails to connect his specific goals (Hollywood smile, 6-month timeline, premium budget) to treatment recommendations. Critical gaps include missing Section 6 (Expectations) for the TP-05 tone profile, vague interpretation section, and scattered filler language throughout. The report needs tightening for professional quality, stronger personalization, and explicit expectation management to meet the Expectation-Calibration tone requirements.",
