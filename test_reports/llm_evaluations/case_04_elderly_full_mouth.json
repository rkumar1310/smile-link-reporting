  "dimensions": {
    "professional_quality": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "Writing quality is poor with significant verbosity, awkward phrasing, and filler language throughout. Multiple sections contain padding that adds no value. Transitions are weak and repetitive patterns appear across sections."
    },
    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Disclaimers are present but weak in several areas. Risk disclosure is vague and lacks proper hedging in places. Some language could be interpreted as more certain than appropriate for a preliminary report."
    },
    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Tone is inconsistent and often generic rather than reflective-contextual. Missing the thoughtful consideration of broader life circumstances expected for TP-03. Several sections feel cookie-cutter rather than contextually aware."
    },
    "personalization": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "Severely lacking personalization. Patient name William is never used despite being provided. Content is almost entirely generic and could apply to anyone. No reference to specific details from intake like being 60+, first-timer, or economy budget focus."
    },
    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Generally respects autonomy with non-directive language. However, some subtle framing issues and the generic nature of Section 11 could be stronger in emphasizing patient control."
    },
    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Basic structure is present but several issues with section utility and flow. Section 4 adds no value. Large gap from Section 4 to Section 10 with no explanation. Section ordering feels disjointed."
