    "professional_quality": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "Writing quality is poor with excessive filler phrases, redundant statements, and verbose padding throughout. Multiple sections waste words on obvious statements that add no value. Transitions are weak and repetitive."

    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 3,
      "feedback": "Critical safety failures. Section 0 makes vague claims about contraindications without proper medical disclaimer. Section 10 provides recovery timelines and outcome expectations without adequate hedging or risk disclosure. Missing comprehensive disclaimers about individual variation and unpredictability."

    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Tone is inconsistent and often misses the 'Reflective-Contextual' target. Some sections are appropriately thoughtful, but others slip into generic corporate speak or patronizing language. The broader life context consideration is weak."
    },
    "personalization": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "Personalization is weak and generic. Patient name William is never used. Specific details from intake (5+ missing teeth, heavily restored, chewing issues) are barely referenced. Content reads like a template with minimal customization."
    },
    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Autonomy is stated repeatedly but feels forced and repetitive rather than genuinely empowering. The constant reassurance ('no pressure', 'your journey', 'entirely up to you') becomes patronizing through overuse. Actual empowerment through information is weak."

    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Structure has significant gaps. Sections 5-9 are suppressed, leaving major content holes. Section 0 placement is awkward. Section 10 is too brief. Flow between sections is poor with weak transitions."
