  "dimensions": {
    "professional_quality": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Writing is generally clear but suffers from verbosity, redundancy, and filler phrases that dilute impact. Multiple sections repeat the same concepts (clinical examination needed, personalization required, outcomes vary). Sentences could be tightened throughout. The report reads like a template with placeholder language rather than purposeful communication."
    },
    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Disclaimers are present and appropriately cautious, but language lacks precision in places. Risk disclosure is present but uses vague hedging ('individual experiences vary', 'additional risks depend on') that could confuse rather than clarify. No guaranteed outcomes are promised, which is good, but the cautionary language sometimes obscures rather than illuminates actual risks."
    },
    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Tone is inconsistent and doesn't fully match the TP-03 Reflective-Contextual profile. The report shifts between clinical/formal (Disclaimer, Risk Factors) and conversational (Context, Next Steps). The 'reflective' aspect is largely absent - there's minimal acknowledgment of William's broader situation (senior, first-timer, exploring options, budget-conscious). The tone feels more like a generic template than thoughtfully contextualized for this specific patient."
    },
    "personalization": {
      "score": 3,
      "feedback": "Report is severely under-personalized. Patient name (William) appears nowhere in the report body. No references to his specific situation: senior age, first-timer status, functional priorities, budget consciousness, durability focus, or exploring-stage decision-making. Content reads as generic template that could apply to any patient with missing teeth. The derived profile shows rich personalization data that is completely unused."
    },
    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Report generally respects patient autonomy by avoiding directive language and emphasizing choice. However, autonomy messaging is repetitive and somewhat passive. The report tells William what will happen ('Your dentist will explain', 'Your dentist will provide') rather than empowering him to drive decisions. Missing is explicit framing of William as the decision-maker with genuine choice about whether, when, and how to proceed."
    },
    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Structure follows logical flow and includes most required sections. Important Notices appropriately placed at top. Disclaimer present and comprehensive. Personal summary, context, and interpretation sections build understanding progressively. Risk factors and next steps complete the report. However, Section 4 (Interpretation) is redundant and adds no new information. Suppressed sections (5-9) are appropriately excluded based on patient profile. Overall structure is sound but could be tightened."

  "overall_assessment": "This report is mediocre (5/10 average) and requires significant revision. While clinically safe and structurally sound, it suffers from severe under-personalization (William's name never appears), excessive verbosity and repetition (clinical examination requirement stated 4+ times), and generic template language that could apply to any patient. The TP-03 Reflective-Contextual tone is largely absent - the report lacks warmth, acknowledgment of William's specific circumstances (senior, first-timer, budget-conscious, durability-focused), and genuine reflection on his situation. Section 4 is entirely redundant and should be deleted. Critical issues include vague risk language ('individual risk varies' without explanation) and failure to explicitly state which treatment options are contraindicated. The report needs complete personalization, tightening of verbose language, and reframing to empower William as the decision-maker rather than positioning him as passive recipient of dentist authority.",
