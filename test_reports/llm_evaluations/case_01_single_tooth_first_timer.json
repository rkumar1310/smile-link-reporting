      "score": 6,

    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Disclaimers are present and generally adequate. Risk information includes appropriate hedging. However, some language could be more cautious, particularly around lifespan claims and aesthetic outcomes."

    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Tone is generally neutral and factual as required for TP-01. However, some sections drift toward slightly warmer or more reassuring language than strictly neutral. Consistency could be improved."

    "personalization": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Minimal personalization despite patient name (John) being provided. Content reads as generic template with very few patient-specific references. Missing opportunities to reference specific patient priorities and situation."

      "score": 8,

      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "All required sections present and generally complete. Logical flow from disclaimer through options to next steps. However, significant length imbalance between sections and some content feels thin."
