  "dimensions": {
    "professional_quality": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "The writing is verbose and repetitive with excessive filler phrases. Multiple sections begin with 'Based on the information provided...' which adds no value. Transitions are wordy and many sentences could be cut in half. The report feels padded rather than concise and professional."
    },
    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Section 1 disclaimer is adequate but could be stronger. Some sections lack appropriate hedging language. Section 5 makes claims about advantages without sufficient qualification. Missing explicit disclaimers about individual variation in outcomes throughout the report."
    },
    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Tone is inconsistent across sections. Some sections are appropriately neutral and factual (Sections 1, 4, 6) while others drift into softer, more reassuring language that doesn't match TP-01 neutral-informative criteria. Section 11 is particularly problematic with phrases like 'your journey' and 'take whatever time feels right'."
    },
    "personalization": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Limited personalization despite available patient data. Patient name 'John' is never used. Specific details about 'upper front tooth' location mentioned in intake are not referenced. Generic content dominates with minimal tailoring to John's specific priorities (natural/subtle aesthetics, balanced budget, 6-month timeline)."
    },
    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Generally respects patient autonomy with appropriate non-directive language in most sections. Section 11 emphasizes patient control effectively. However, some subtle directive language appears in Sections 3 and 5 that could be more neutral."
    },
    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "All required sections present but several are underdeveloped. Section 7 (Trade-offs) and Section 8 (Process) are too brief to be useful. Section flow is logical but some sections feel like placeholders rather than complete content. Comparison table in Section 6 is well-structured."

Clinical safety needs strengthening with better hedging and disclaimers. Tone inconsistency is problematic - some sections are appropriately neutral while others drift into soft, reassuring language inappropriate for TP-01. Personalization is weak despite available patient data. Multiple sections are underdeveloped placeholders rather than complete content. Significant revision needed to tighten writing, strengthen safety language, standardize tone, and add genuine personalization.",
