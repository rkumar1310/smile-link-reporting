  "overall_score": 5.5,
  "dimensions": {
    "professional_quality": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Writing is generally clear but suffers from significant verbosity and filler language. Multiple sections contain redundant statements, overly cautious hedging that repeats across sections, and sentences that could be tightened. The report uses placeholder-style language ('Based on your questionnaire responses,' 'Your dentist will assess') excessively, padding word count without adding value."
    },
    "clinical_safety": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Safety language is generally appropriate with adequate disclaimers, but contains some problematic elements. The opening disclaimer is strong, but subsequent sections use statistics (90-95% implant success, 2-5% infection rate) without sufficient context about individual variation. Risk factors section is present but uses vague language ('mild to moderate tenderness') and presents infection/failure rates without adequate hedging about how these apply to John's specific situation. The report appropriately avoids guarantees but could be more cautious about presenting population statistics as if they apply to the individual patient."
    },
    "tone_appropriateness": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Tone is generally neutral and informative as specified (TP-01), but inconsistency exists. Most sections maintain appropriate professional distance, but some language shifts toward false warmth or unnecessary reassurance. Phrases like 'Your surrounding teeth are stable, which means both treatment options are suitable for you' use slightly warmer language than pure neutral-informative tone requires. Some sections feel overly cautious in a way that undermines confidence without adding safety value. The tone doesn't fully match the patient profile (first-timer with mild anxiety) - it could be slightly more reassuring without becoming emotional."
    },
    "personalization": {
      "score": 4,
      "feedback": "Personalization is severely lacking. While the report addresses John by name in a few places, it fails to incorporate his specific profile characteristics. The patient profile shows John is a first-timer with conservative aesthetic tolerance, mild anxiety, balanced budget, and minimally invasive philosophy - none of this is reflected in the content. Section 2 (Personal Summary) is generic and could apply to any single missing tooth case. Treatment options are presented without connecting to John's stated priorities. The report reads as a template with name insertion rather than genuinely personalized content."
    },
    "patient_autonomy": {
      "score": 5,
      "feedback": "Patient autonomy is partially respected but contains subtle directive language and framing that subtly influences choice. While the report avoids explicit recommendations, it uses language that makes certain options seem preferable. The comparison table uses asymmetric framing ('Stimulates bone' vs 'Does not prevent bone loss') that subtly favors implants. Phrases like 'may suit you if' create implicit hierarchies. The report emphasizes implant benefits (bone preservation, longevity) more prominently than bridge benefits. Section 6 closing statement 'Your dentist will assess clinical factors; you decide which aligns with your priorities' is good but comes too late after biased framing."
    },
    "structure_completeness": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "Structure is logically organized and includes all required sections in appropriate order. The flow from disclaimer through personal summary, context, interpretation, options, comparison, trade-offs, process, costs, risks, and next steps is logical. However, there are issues with section redundancy and length imbalance. Section 7 (Trade-offs) significantly duplicates Section 6 (Comparison), making it feel incomplete rather than complementary. Some sections are too brief (Section 2, Section 4, Section 8) while others are overly long (Section 5). The structure would benefit from consolidation and better delineation of what each section uniquely contributes."
