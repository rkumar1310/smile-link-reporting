# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing a significant section of teeth next to each other. We understand this affects much more than just eating—it can feel like you've lost part of your confidence. Your goal is to feel whole again.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When a large segment of teeth is gone, the impact goes beyond the physical. Many people describe feeling incomplete, uncertain when eating, or self-conscious in ways they didn't expect. Simple things—like enjoying a meal or smiling freely—may feel more complicated now.

The remaining teeth can't fully compensate for such a gap. You might notice uneven pressure, difficulty with certain foods, or constant awareness of what's missing. These experiences are completely valid and shared by many in your situation.

What matters most is finding a solution that restores not just function, but also your sense of normalcy.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For a large missing segment, implant-supported bridges are typically recommended. These provide the structural support needed to restore reliable chewing. Two approaches are commonly discussed.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Bridge of 6 Teeth on 3 Implants

**What this involves**
Three implants anchor a bridge that replaces six teeth in the affected area.

**What you can expect**
A stable restoration that distributes chewing forces naturally across the segment.

**What others in your situation have valued**
- The security of a fixed solution
- Being able to eat without thinking about it
- A natural feeling when biting
- No reliance on remaining teeth

**What to be aware of**
- The process takes several months
- Surgery is involved
- The investment is significant

# Section 6: Option 2 — Bridge of 10 Teeth on 4 Implants

**What this involves**
Four implants support an extended bridge replacing up to ten teeth.

**What you can expect**
A comprehensive restoration for larger segments, offering maximum stability.

**What others in your situation have valued**
- Complete restoration of an entire section
- Very high stability
- Efficient use of implants
- Long-term reliability

**What to be aware of**
- Higher cost
- More extensive planning
- Depends on available bone

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

The goal is for chewing to become automatic again—something you don't have to think about. After an adjustment period, most people find the restoration feels natural and secure.
