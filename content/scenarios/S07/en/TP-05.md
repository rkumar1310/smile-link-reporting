# Section 2: Personal Summary

You are missing a larger contiguous segment of teeth. This primarily has a functional impact: your main goal is restoring a stable, reliable chewing function that feels natural in daily life.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When more than five adjacent teeth are missing, the functioning of the bite changes significantly. The remaining teeth cannot adequately compensate for such a large gap. Many people experience that chewing becomes more difficult, that they automatically avoid certain foods, and that there is a constant awareness of the missing segment.

In this scenario, it's not just about comfort—it's about function. The distribution of forces during biting and chewing is disturbed, which can lead to uneven loading of the remaining teeth. Many people also notice that their confidence in daily eating diminishes.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For a large contiguous segment of missing teeth, the focus is usually on implant-supported bridges. These solutions are designed to restore chewing function structurally. Two options are commonly discussed, differing in the number of implants and the extent of the bridge.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Bridge of 6 Teeth on 3 Implants

**What this involves**
Three implants serve as anchor points for a bridge that replaces six teeth.

**What you can expect**
A stable and manageable solution for a medium-sized segment, with good distribution of chewing forces.

**Advantages**
- Durable and functional restoration
- Limited number of implants
- Natural chewing function possible
- Fixed solution without support from natural teeth

**Points to consider**
- Requires sufficient bone volume
- Treatment in multiple steps
- Higher cost than smaller solutions

**This may be logical for you if...**
You are looking for a reliable solution for a larger segment, without making the treatment unnecessarily complex.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Bridge of 10 Teeth on 4 Implants

**What this involves**
Four implants support a longer bridge that replaces up to ten teeth within one segment.

**What you can expect**
An extensive and very stable solution that restores a large part of chewing function at once.

**Advantages**
- Very high stability
- Efficient reconstruction of a large segment
- Even distribution of forces
- Suitable for extensive tooth loss

**Points to consider**
- Higher total cost
- Careful planning required
- Dependent on bone volume and anatomy

**This may be logical for you if...**
You want comprehensive and durable restoration and choose maximum stability in the long term.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

In both options, the goal is that you can chew confidently and comfortably again. The emphasis is entirely on function and reliability. After placement, a short adjustment period usually follows, after which the solution feels like a fixed part of the dentition.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Bridge on implants: average 4-7 months, depending on healing and planning

After the surgical phase, some days of discomfort may occur. Most daily activities are usually resumed quickly.

# Section 9: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Bridge on implants**
- Recovery time: 3-7 days
- Possible impact: discomfort and/or swelling
- Daily functioning: temporary adjustment; acclimatization 1-2 weeks after bridge placement

# Section 10: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Bridge 6 teeth on 3 implants: approximately €6,500 - €9,000
- Bridge 10 teeth on 4 implants: approximately €10,000 - €15,000

The final cost depends on material choice, technical execution, and individual circumstances. Costs are part of a long-term consideration around stability and comfort.

# Section 11: Next Steps

To make a well-prepared decision, it is advisable to discuss the size of the segment, your chewing comfort, and your expectations together with a dentist. The Smile-link decision guide helps you approach this conversation in a structured and confident manner.
