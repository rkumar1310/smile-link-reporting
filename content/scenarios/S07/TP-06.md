# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing a larger contiguous segment of teeth. There are treatment options available. What you choose to do is entirely your decision.

# Section 3: Your Situation

A large gap affects chewing function significantly. The remaining teeth cannot fully compensate for this space. You may have noticed changes in how you eat, or you may have adapted.

Whether and when to address this is your choice. A dental professional can explain the implications, but the decision of what to pursue is yours alone.

# Section 4: Treatment Directions

Implant-supported bridges are the standard approach for large missing segments. Two options are described below for your consideration.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Bridge of 6 Teeth on 3 Implants

**What this offers you**
- A fixed, stable restoration
- Even distribution of chewing forces
- Independence from remaining teeth

**What to consider**
- Requires surgery and healing
- Significant investment
- Multiple appointments

# Section 6: Option 2 — Bridge of 10 Teeth on 4 Implants

**What this offers you**
- Comprehensive restoration of larger segment
- Maximum stability
- Efficient use of implants

**What to consider**
- Higher cost
- More extensive planning
- Depends on bone availability

# Section 7-11: [Practical Information]

Duration: 4-7 months | Recovery: 3-7 days | Cost: €6,500-€15,000 depending on extent

**Your next steps are entirely up to you.** You may review this information, consult with a dentist, or take time to decide. There is no external pressure.
