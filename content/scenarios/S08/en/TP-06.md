# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing multiple teeth in different areas. Treatment options exist. What you choose to do is entirely your decision.

# Section 3: Your Situation

Scattered tooth loss affects chewing in multiple zones simultaneously. You may have adapted, or you may find the situation limiting. Both experiences are valid.

How to approach treatment—which zones, in what order, using which method—involves personal decisions based on your priorities. A dental professional can explain options; you decide what to pursue.
