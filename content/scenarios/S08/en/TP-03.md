# Section 2: Personal Summary

You are missing multiple teeth spread over different zones in the mouth. This primarily has a functional impact, with comfort, stability, and an even distribution of chewing forces being central.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When more than five teeth are missing but not next to each other, a more complex picture often emerges than with one contiguous segment. Each zone contributes to chewing comfort in its own way, which can make the whole feel less predictable.

Many people notice that they unconsciously adjust their chewing behavior: certain zones are spared, others take on extra load. This can lead to fatigue, uncertainty during firm eating, or the feeling that the bite is no longer evenly distributed. Because the missing teeth are scattered, there is rarely one clear problem spot, but rather a sum of small functional disruptions.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions — Overview

For scattered, extensive tooth loss, a zone-oriented approach is usually chosen. This means examining per zone which solution is most suitable. In this scenario, two functional directions are usually considered, which can be flexibly combined with each other.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Multiple Implants with Crowns per Zone

**What this involves**
Per missing tooth, an implant is placed with a crown on top. This approach is applied in the zones where teeth are missing.

**What you can expect**
An individual and independent replacement per tooth, with natural distribution of chewing forces over the different zones.

**Advantages**
- Very flexible per zone
- Natural loading per tooth
- No reliance on surrounding teeth
- Well adaptable to changing situations

**Points to consider**
- Multiple surgical procedures
- Higher total cost
- Process may feel longer due to spreading

**This may be logical for you if...**
You want maximum functional control per zone and are willing to follow a more extensive process for the most natural possible distribution.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Bridges on Implants per Zone

**What this involves**
Within one zone, multiple missing teeth are replaced by a bridge supported by implants.

**What you can expect**
A structural solution per zone, where multiple teeth are restored together.

**Advantages**
- Fewer implants needed per zone
- Clear and manageable approach
- Strong functional stability

**Points to consider**
- Less individual per tooth
- Less flexible for later adjustments
- Requires sufficient bone volume per zone

**This may be logical for you if...**
You are looking for a practical and structured solution with a good balance between stability and treatment complexity.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

In both directions, the emphasis is on functional restoration and reliability. The goal is that you can chew again without thinking, with an even distribution of the load over all zones. Visibility usually plays a subordinate role; daily comfort is paramount.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Zone-oriented implant solutions: average 4-8 months, depending on the number of zones and the sequence of steps

After surgical procedures, some days of discomfort may occur. Most daily activities are usually resumed quickly.

# Section 9: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Zone-oriented implant solutions**
- Recovery time: 2-5 days per zone
- Possible impact: discomfort or sensitivity
- Daily functioning: limited impact per procedure; total spread over months

# Section 10: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Implant with crown: approximately €2,200 - €2,500 per tooth
- More extensive zone solutions: up to approximately €9,000, depending on number of zones and approach

The final cost depends on the number of treated zones, material choice, and technical execution. Costs are part of a global functional consideration.

# Section 11: Next Steps

To make a well-prepared decision, it is advisable to examine per zone together with a dentist which approach best fits your comfort, expectations, and planning. The Smile-link decision guide helps you approach this conversation in a structured and confident manner.
