# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing multiple teeth in different areas of your mouth. We understand this can make daily life feel more complicated than it should be—eating requires more thought, and there may be a constant awareness that things don't feel right.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When teeth are missing in several different places, the experience is often hard to describe. It's not one problem—it's a collection of small disruptions that add up. You might find yourself avoiding certain foods, chewing in specific ways, or feeling that your bite is somehow unbalanced.

This situation is more complex because there's no single area to focus on. Each zone has its own impact, creating a cumulative effect that can be frustrating and tiring. Many people in your situation feel ready to address the whole picture, not just individual gaps.
