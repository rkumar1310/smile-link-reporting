# Section 2: Personal Summary

You have old dental restorations that are now visible, worn, or failing. Your goal is to update these restorations with modern solutions that look better and function reliably.

# Section 3: Your Situation

Dental work performed years ago—fillings, crowns, or other restorations—may no longer look or function as well as they once did. Materials darken, margins become visible, and wear can affect both appearance and integrity.

Many people reach a point where old dental work becomes noticeable in ways it wasn't before. Dark metal margins, discolored fillings, or outdated crowns can affect how your smile looks, even if the underlying teeth are healthy.

This scenario is about updating rather than treating disease—replacing outdated work with modern materials and techniques that blend better and last longer.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For old restorations, replacement with modern materials is typically recommended. The approach depends on the type and extent of existing work.
