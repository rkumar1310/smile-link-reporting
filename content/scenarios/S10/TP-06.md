# Section 2: Personal Summary

Most of your teeth cannot be saved. Treatment options exist for full restoration. What you choose to do is entirely your decision.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When most teeth cannot be preserved, the focus shifts to comprehensive restoration. You may feel ready to address this, or you may need time to process. Both responses are valid.

A dental professional can explain options and implications. The decision of how to proceed—or whether to proceed—remains yours.
