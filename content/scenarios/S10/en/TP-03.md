# Section 2: Personal Summary

For you, almost all teeth can no longer be saved. Your main goal is restoring comfort, stability, and quality of life, with a solution that gives you confidence again when eating, speaking, and smiling.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When the majority of teeth can no longer be preserved, a situation arises that can be both functionally and emotionally heavy. Chewing is often difficult, painful, or uncertain. The bite feels unstable and daily activities require more attention than before.

Additionally, there is the awareness that preservation is no longer a realistic option. Many people experience this as a turning point: the focus shifts from restoring what's still there to rebuilding a fully functional whole. In this scenario, it's not about small corrections, but about a thoughtful choice for a solution that brings peace and security again.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

In a situation where almost all teeth cannot be saved, three full-mouth directions are usually discussed. They differ in fixation, experience, maintenance, and cost. Which direction fits best depends on your expectations, comfort preferences, and how definitive you want the solution to be.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Fixed Denture Upper and Lower

**What this involves**
In both jaws, a fixed bridge is placed on multiple implants (for example All-on-4 or All-on-6).

**What you can expect**
A completely fixed solution that approaches maximum stability and natural feeling.

**Advantages**
- Very high stability
- Fixed feeling when chewing and speaking
- No removable parts
- Great improvement in quality of life

**Points to consider**
- High cost
- Long-term and phased treatment
- Careful planning and healing needed

**This may be logical for you if...**
You choose maximum fixation and comfort and are willing to invest in a durable total solution.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Snap-on Denture Upper and Lower

**What this involves**
Removable dentures that snap onto implants in both jaws.

**What you can expect**
A more stable and comfortable solution than a classic denture, with removable character.

**Advantages**
- Better stability than loose prostheses
- Lower cost than fixed bridges
- Less complex treatment
- Easily removable for maintenance

**Points to consider**
- Not completely fixed
- Daily removal remains necessary
- Less natural feeling than fixed teeth

**This may be logical for you if...**
You are looking for a functional and affordable full-mouth solution with clear improvement in comfort.

# Section 7: Option 3 — Fixed Denture Upper + Snap-on Denture Lower

**What this involves**
A fixed bridge in the upper jaw combined with a removable snap-on denture in the lower jaw.

**What you can expect**
A hybrid approach that combines fixation and budget-conscious choices.

**Advantages**
- Good balance between stability and cost
- Fixed solution where appearance and function matter most
- Flexibility per jaw

**Points to consider**
- Difference in experience between upper and lower
- More maintenance planning
- Careful coordination needed

**This may be logical for you if...**
You are looking for a balanced combination of comfort, fixation, and feasibility.

# Section 8: Expected Results & Comfort

The goal of each option is that you can function securely and comfortably again in daily life. The degree of fixation and experience differs per solution, but all directions are intended to noticeably improve your daily life.

# Section 9: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Full-mouth treatment**
- Recovery time: 5-10 days per surgical phase
- Possible impact: swelling and discomfort
- Daily functioning: recovery moments per phase; total duration spread over months

# Section 10: Duration and Cost Indication

- Fixed denture upper and lower: approximately €20,000 - €50,000
- Snap-on denture upper and lower: approximately €8,000 - €15,000
- Combination fixed + snap-on denture: approximately €20,000 - €30,000

Treatment duration is usually between 4 and 9 months. After surgical steps, approximately one week of discomfort or swelling may occur.

# Section 11: Next Steps

To make a well-prepared decision, it is advisable to discuss your priorities around fixation, maintenance, comfort, and budget together with a dentist. The Smile-link decision guide helps you approach this conversation in a structured and confident manner.
