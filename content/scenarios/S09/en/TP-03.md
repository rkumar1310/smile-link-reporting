# Section 2: Personal Micro-Summary

You are completely edentulous in one jaw. Your main goal is restoring comfort, stability, and confidence, so that eating, speaking, and smiling feel natural again.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When a complete jaw is edentulous, this has a major impact on daily functioning. Many people experience uncertainty when eating, speaking, or smiling, even when they outwardly adapt to the situation. Chewing requires more attention, strength is limited, and the feeling of stability is often lacking.

Besides the functional aspect, psychological comfort also plays a role. The absence of fixed teeth can affect self-confidence and means constantly taking the prosthesis or empty jaw into account. In this scenario, it's not about one tooth or one zone, but about restoring a complete whole.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For a completely edentulous jaw, two clear full-mouth directions are usually discussed. Both make use of implants, but differ greatly in fixation, ease of use, and experience. The choice depends on your expectations, comfort preferences, and how definitive you want the solution to be.

# Section 5: Option 1 — All-on-4 or All-on-6 Fixed Bridge

**What this involves**
A fixed bridge is anchored on four or six implants and replaces all teeth in one jaw.

**What you can expect**
A fixed solution that feels like natural teeth and is not removable.

**Advantages**
- Very high stability
- Fixed feeling when chewing and speaking
- No removal or loosening
- Natural and reliable in daily use

**Points to consider**
- Higher cost
- Longer treatment duration
- Careful planning and healing needed

**This may be logical for you if...**
You want maximum comfort and fixation and are willing to invest in a durable full-mouth solution.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Snap-on Denture on 2-4 Implants

**What this involves**
A removable denture that snaps onto two to four implants for extra stability.

**What you can expect**
A more stable alternative than a classic loose denture, with the possibility to remove the denture.

**Advantages**
- Better stability than a loose denture
- Lower cost than a fixed bridge
- Less complex treatment
- Easily removable for cleaning

**Points to consider**
- Not completely fixed
- Daily removal remains necessary
- Less natural feeling than fixed teeth

**This may be logical for you if...**
You are looking for a functional and affordable solution with clear improvement compared to a classic denture.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

In both options, the goal is that you experience security and comfort in daily life again. With a fixed bridge, the emphasis is on fixation and naturalness; with a snap-on denture, on practical stability and manageability. The experience differs clearly, but both can mean a great improvement.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- All-on-4 / All-on-6: average 4-9 months
- Snap-on denture on implants: usually shorter, depending on planning

After surgical steps, approximately one week of discomfort or swelling may occur. After that, you usually gradually resume normal activities.

# Section 9: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**All-on-4 / All-on-6**
- Recovery time: 5-10 days
- Possible impact: swelling, discomfort, pressure sensation
- Daily functioning: normal activities usually resumed within 1-2 weeks

**Snap-on denture on implants**
- Recovery time: comparable, often slightly less intense
- Possible impact: discomfort or swelling
- Daily functioning: gradual resumption

# Section 10: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- All-on-4 / All-on-6 fixed bridge: approximately €10,000 - €20,000
- Snap-on denture on implants: approximately €4,000 - €9,000

The final cost depends on material choice, number of implants, and technical execution. Costs are part of a long-term consideration around comfort and quality of life.

# Section 11: Next Steps

To make a well-prepared decision, it is advisable to discuss your expectations around a fixed solution, maintenance, and comfort together with a dentist. The Smile-link decision guide helps you approach this conversation in a structured and confident manner.
