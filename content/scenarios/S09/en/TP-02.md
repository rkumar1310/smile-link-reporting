# Section 2: Personal Summary

You have no teeth remaining in one jaw. We understand this affects so much more than just eating—it touches on confidence, comfort, and how you feel in everyday moments. You deserve a solution that helps you feel whole again.

# Section 3: Your Situation

Living without teeth in an entire jaw is challenging in ways that others may not fully understand. Simple things—eating a favorite food, laughing freely, speaking without hesitation—can feel complicated or uncertain. Many people describe a loss of confidence that goes beyond the physical.

You may have been managing with a traditional denture, or you may have been avoiding situations altogether. Either way, the feeling of instability or "emptiness" is something many in your situation share.

What matters now is finding a solution that restores not just function, but your sense of normalcy and confidence in daily life.
