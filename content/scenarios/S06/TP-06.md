# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're dealing with a combination of missing teeth and aesthetic concerns. There are treatment options that address both. What you choose to do, and how you prioritize different aspects, is entirely your decision.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When functional gaps and cosmetic issues coexist, treatment can address both together or separately, depending on your preferences. Some people prioritize function; others prioritize appearance; many want both.

There's no objectively correct approach. What matters is what you value and what trade-offs you're willing to accept. A dental professional can explain the options, but you decide which path to take.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Direction

A combined approach—addressing function and aesthetics together—is one option. Treating them separately or partially is also possible. The information below describes the comprehensive approach; you may choose to pursue all, some, or none of it.

# Section 5: Treatment Option — Implants Combined with Veneers or Crowns

**What this involves**
Missing teeth are replaced with implants and crowns. Visible teeth with cosmetic issues are treated with veneers or crowns. The work is coordinated for a unified result.

**What this offers you**
- Restoration of both function and appearance
- A coordinated, comprehensive approach
- One treatment addressing multiple concerns

**What to consider**
- Multi-phase process requiring substantial time
- Significant financial investment
- Requires commitment to see through

**You might choose this if...**
You want a comprehensive solution and are prepared for the process involved.

# Section 6: Expected Results & Comfort

Combined treatment can improve both chewing function and smile appearance. Results vary by individual. Some adjustment period is typical.

# Section 7: Duration of the Process

- Combined treatment: 4–7 months

# Section 8: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Implants**
- Recovery time: 2–5 days
- Possible impact: discomfort, swelling
- Daily functioning: temporary adjustment

**Veneers or crowns**
- Recovery time: 1–2 days
- Possible impact: slight sensitivity
- Daily functioning: minimal disruption

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500 per tooth
- Veneers or crowns: approximately €900 – €1,300 per tooth

These are ranges to help you plan.

# Section 10: Considerations for Your Decision

Questions you might ask yourself:
- Which matters more to me right now: function or appearance?
- Am I ready for a comprehensive process, or would I prefer to start smaller?
- What information do I still need before deciding?

# Section 11: Next Steps

**Your next steps are entirely up to you.** Options include:

- Review this information at your own pace
- Consider your priorities and preferences
- Prepare questions for a dental consultation
- Schedule an appointment when you feel ready
- Decide to address only some concerns, or wait

This is your decision. There's no external pressure or timeline. Take whatever time you need.
