# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're experiencing both functional loss and aesthetic dissatisfaction. This combination creates a particular kind of complexity—it's not just about fixing isolated problems, but about restoring a sense of wholeness to your smile.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When missing teeth and visible imperfections coexist, the experience often transcends either issue alone. It's not simply "I can't chew well" or "I don't like how this looks"—it's a deeper sense that the whole picture no longer coheres.

Many people in this situation describe a kind of fragmentation: the functional gaps affect confidence in eating, while the aesthetic concerns affect confidence in smiling. Together, they create a persistent background awareness that something is off.

What's interesting about this scenario is that addressing only one aspect often feels incomplete. Filling a gap without improving the surrounding appearance can leave the smile still feeling unbalanced. Improving aesthetics without addressing function can feel superficial. This is why integrated approaches tend to resonate with people facing this combination.

The goal is not perfection, but coherence—a smile that functions well and looks like it belongs to you.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Direction

For combined functional and aesthetic concerns, a hybrid approach is typically recommended. This means addressing the structural issues (missing teeth) while simultaneously improving the visible appearance (color, shape, symmetry). The result is planned as a unified outcome, not a series of separate fixes.

# Section 5: Treatment Option — Implants Combined with Veneers or Crowns

**What this involves**
Missing teeth are restored with implants and crowns. Visible teeth that detract from the overall appearance are improved with veneers or crowns. Everything is coordinated to create one cohesive result.

**What you can expect**
A comprehensive treatment that addresses function and aesthetics together, with careful attention to how the pieces fit.

**The broader picture**
- Function and appearance are treated as interconnected
- The final result is designed as a whole
- Proportions, color, and balance are considered throughout
- The outcome reflects your individual features

**Worth reflecting on**
- This is a significant commitment in time and cost
- Multiple phases are involved
- Success depends on careful planning and coordination

**This approach often resonates with people who...**
Want to address the full picture rather than settling for partial improvements.

# Section 6: Expected Results & Comfort

The goal is a smile that feels integrated—where function and appearance support each other. This means being able to eat without concern and smile without self-consciousness. The result should feel natural, not artificial or overdone.

After the various treatment phases, there's typically a brief adjustment period. Most people find the end result worth the process.

# Section 7: Duration of the Process

- Combined treatment: typically 4–7 months

The timeline depends on complexity, healing, and how the functional and aesthetic phases are sequenced.

# Section 8: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Implants**
- Recovery: 2–5 days per phase
- Experience: mild discomfort, possible swelling
- Daily life: temporary adjustments

**Veneers or crowns**
- Recovery: 1–2 days
- Experience: slight sensitivity
- Daily life: minimal disruption

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500 per tooth
- Veneers or crowns: approximately €900 – €1,300 per tooth

The total investment depends on the scope of treatment. It's worth considering in terms of long-term value rather than immediate cost.

# Section 10: Considerations for Your Decision

Questions that might help clarify your thinking:
- How much does overall coherence matter to you?
- Are you prepared for a multi-phase process?
- What would it mean to feel whole again in your smile?

# Section 11: Next Steps

This decision benefits from reflection. When you're ready:
- Consider what matters most—function, appearance, or their integration
- Prepare questions about how the treatment would be coordinated
- Use the Smile-link decision guide to organize your thoughts

The path forward is about more than fixing problems—it's about restoring something that feels genuinely yours.
