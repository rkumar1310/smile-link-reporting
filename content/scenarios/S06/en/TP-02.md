# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're dealing with both missing teeth and concerns about how your smile looks. We understand this can feel overwhelming—it's not just about function or appearance alone, but about wanting everything to feel right again.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When you're facing both gaps and aesthetic issues at the same time, the experience is often more complex than either problem alone. It's not just about filling a space or fixing a discoloration—it's about the feeling that your smile as a whole doesn't reflect who you are anymore.

You might find yourself thinking: "If I fix the missing tooth, will the rest still look uneven?" Or: "Is it worth addressing the color if there are bigger issues?" These overlapping concerns are completely natural, and many people in your situation share them.

What matters is finding an approach that addresses everything together, so you can feel confident in the whole picture—not just isolated improvements.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Direction

For situations like yours, a combined approach often works best. This means addressing the missing teeth while also improving the appearance of visible teeth that bother you. The goal is one coherent result, not a patchwork of separate fixes.

# Section 5: Treatment Option — Implants Combined with Veneers or Crowns

**What this involves**
Missing teeth are replaced with implants and crowns. At the same time, cosmetic concerns on other teeth are addressed with veneers or crowns—all coordinated to create a unified look.

**What you can expect**
A treatment that restores both function and aesthetics, planned carefully so everything works together.

**What others in your situation have valued**
- Being able to address everything at once
- Seeing real improvement in both comfort and appearance
- A smile that finally feels "complete"
- Coordination between functional and cosmetic work

**What to be aware of**
- The treatment involves multiple phases
- The investment is significant
- Careful planning is needed to align all the pieces

**This might feel right if...**
You're ready for a comprehensive approach—one that gives you back both comfort and confidence.

# Section 6: Expected Results & Comfort

The goal is a smile that feels balanced and natural. You should be able to eat comfortably and smile confidently, knowing everything works together. Most people experience a short adjustment period, but find the result deeply satisfying.

# Section 7: Duration of the Process

- Combined treatment: typically 4–7 months, depending on complexity

The functional and aesthetic work is coordinated so the final result comes together as a whole.

# Section 8: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Implants**
- Recovery: 2–5 days
- You may experience: mild discomfort, swelling
- Daily life: temporary adjustment to chewing

**Veneers or crowns**
- Recovery: 1–2 days
- You may experience: slight sensitivity
- Daily life: no significant disruption

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500 per tooth
- Veneers or crowns: approximately €900 – €1,300 per tooth

The total depends on your specific situation. These figures help you plan for the conversation ahead.

# Section 10: Considerations for Your Decision

Before meeting with a dentist, you might reflect on:
- What bothers you most—function, appearance, or both equally?
- How important is having one unified result?
- What questions do you want answered?

# Section 11: Next Steps

There's no rush. When you feel ready:
- Take time to think about what a "complete" smile means to you
- Write down your concerns and priorities
- Schedule a consultation to explore your options
