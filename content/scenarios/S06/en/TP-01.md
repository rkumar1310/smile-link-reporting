# Section 2: Personal Summary

You are dealing with a combination of missing teeth and aesthetic concerns. Your goal is not only to function comfortably again, but also to achieve a harmonious and well-maintained smile where everything fits together better.

# Section 3: Your Situation

In this scenario, two aspects play simultaneously. On one hand, one or more teeth are missing, which affects chewing comfort and stability. On the other hand, there are visible aesthetic elements that bother you, such as color differences, shape, wear, or asymmetry.

Many people experience this as more complex than a purely functional or purely aesthetic problem. It's not about one clear complaint, but about the feeling that the whole picture "no longer fits." Sometimes the emphasis is more on function, sometimes more on appearance, but usually it's about the combination. This makes this scenario typical for people looking for an overall result, not a single procedure.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Direction

With a combination of tooth loss and aesthetic concerns, a hybrid approach is usually chosen. Functional solutions (such as implants) are combined with aesthetic corrections (such as crowns or veneers). The goal is to improve both stability and appearance in one coherent plan.

# Section 5: Treatment Option — Implants Combined with Veneers or Crowns

**What this involves**
Missing teeth are replaced per zone by implants with crowns. At the same time, visible teeth that are aesthetically bothersome are corrected with porcelain veneers or crowns.

**What you can expect**
A combined treatment where function and aesthetics are addressed together, with attention to proportions, color, and balance.

**Advantages**
- Restoration of chewing function and stability
- Improvement of aesthetics in the same treatment
- More harmony in the overall appearance of the smile
- Solutions are tailored per zone

**Points to consider**
- Combination treatment with multiple steps
- Higher total cost
- Careful planning needed to align everything

**This may be logical for you if...**
You notice that a single solution is insufficient and consciously choose a coherent approach that improves both function and appearance.

# Section 6: Expected Results & Comfort

The goal of this treatment is for your smile to feel balanced again, both when chewing and when smiling. Comfort and naturalness are central. The aesthetic corrections are intended to match your face and personality, not to be excessively noticeable. After the various steps, a short adjustment period may occur.

# Section 7: Duration of the Process

- Combined treatment (implants + aesthetic corrections): average 4-7 months, depending on the number of zones and the sequence of steps

After surgical procedures, 1-2 days of discomfort may occur. The further aesthetic steps usually proceed without recovery time.

# Section 8: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Implants**
- Recovery time: 2-5 days per surgical phase
- Possible impact: discomfort and/or swelling
- Daily functioning: temporary adjustment

**Veneers or crowns**
- Recovery time: 1-2 days
- Possible impact: slight sensitivity
- Daily functioning: no structural limitation

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Implant with crown: approximately €2,200 - €2,500 per tooth
- Porcelain veneers or crowns: approximately €900 - €1,300 per tooth

The final cost depends on the number of treated teeth, material choice, and technical execution. Costs are part of a global consideration around comfort, durability, and appearance.

# Section 10: Considerations for Your Decision

- Do you primarily want functional restoration, aesthetic improvement, or both in balance?
- How important is coherence and uniformity in your smile?
- Are you willing to follow a treatment that proceeds in phases for a better end result?

These questions help clarify your priorities before consultation with a dentist.

# Section 11: Next Steps

To make a well-prepared decision, it is advisable to discuss a global plan per zone together with a dentist. The Smile-link decision guide helps you approach this conversation in a structured and confident manner.
