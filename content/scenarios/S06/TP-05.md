# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're dealing with both missing teeth and aesthetic concerns. A combined approach can address both, though it's important to understand what this involves and what outcomes are realistic.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When functional gaps and cosmetic issues coexist, the situation is inherently more complex than either problem alone. You're not just filling a space or improving appearance—you're trying to create a cohesive result from multiple interrelated elements.

This complexity affects treatment planning. Decisions about one aspect (like implant placement) have implications for another (like how adjacent teeth should look). The goal is harmony, but achieving it requires careful coordination and sometimes compromise.

It's also worth noting that while significant improvement is achievable, "perfection" is not a realistic goal. Natural teeth have variations; restored teeth will too. The aim is a result that looks natural, functions well, and represents a clear improvement—not an idealized transformation.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Direction

For combined concerns, an integrated approach is recommended. This means planning the functional and aesthetic work together, so decisions account for the overall result rather than being made in isolation.

# Section 5: Treatment Option — Implants Combined with Veneers or Crowns

**What this involves**
Missing teeth are replaced with implants and crowns. Cosmetic concerns are addressed with veneers or crowns on other visible teeth. Everything is coordinated.

**What you can realistically expect**
- Significant improvement in both function and appearance
- A result that looks natural, though not identical to untreated teeth
- A process that requires time, multiple phases, and substantial investment

**What this option offers**
- Comprehensive treatment of interrelated issues
- Coordinated planning for unified results
- Restoration of both chewing function and smile confidence

**What this option requires**
- Commitment to a multi-phase process
- Significant financial investment
- Patience with the timeline
- Acceptance that outcomes depend on many variables

**Important to understand**
Success depends on individual factors: bone quality, gum condition, existing teeth, healing ability. While outcomes are generally good, they cannot be assured in advance. Some adjustments or refinements may be needed.

# Section 6: Expected Results & Comfort

The goal is functional comfort and aesthetic improvement. You should be able to chew without difficulty and feel better about your smile. However, some adjustment period is normal, and the result may feel different from what you're used to—even if it looks and functions better.

# Section 7: Duration of the Process

- Combined treatment: typically 4–7 months

This timeline can vary based on complexity, healing, and whether preparatory work is needed.

# Section 8: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Implants**
- Recovery: 2–5 days per phase
- Daily life: Some adjustment to chewing; most activities resume normally

**Veneers or crowns**
- Recovery: 1–2 days
- Daily life: Minor sensitivity; no significant disruption

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500 per tooth
- Veneers or crowns: approximately €900 – €1,300 per tooth

Total cost for combined treatment can be substantial. It's worth viewing this as a long-term investment in quality of life.

# Section 10: Considerations for Your Decision

Before proceeding, consider:
- Are your expectations aligned with what's achievable?
- How important is improvement vs. how important is perfection?
- What questions do you have about potential complications or limitations?

# Section 11: Next Steps

To make an informed decision:
- Be honest about your expectations
- Prepare questions about realistic outcomes
- Ask about potential limitations and what-if scenarios
- Use the Smile-link decision guide to organize your thinking

A good outcome requires clear understanding of both possibilities and limitations.
