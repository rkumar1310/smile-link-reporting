# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing one tooth in a visible area. Both available options can provide meaningful improvement, though each comes with its own considerations. Understanding what to realistically expect will help you make a well-informed choice.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When a tooth is missing in a visible position, it tends to be more noticeable than many people initially expect—both to yourself and to others. This can affect how comfortable you feel smiling or speaking in certain situations.

Beyond appearance, there are functional considerations as well. The gap may affect how you chew, and over time, there's potential for neighboring teeth to shift slightly. These changes happen gradually and aren't guaranteed, but they're worth being aware of.

It's also worth noting that while both treatment options can significantly improve your situation, neither will perfectly replicate what was there before. The goal is restoration, not replication—a result that looks natural and feels comfortable, even if it's not identical to your original tooth.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For a single missing tooth in the aesthetic zone, there are two established approaches. Each has strengths and limitations. The right choice depends on your priorities—whether that's longevity, simplicity, cost, or speed.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Single Implant with Crown

**What this involves**
A titanium post is surgically placed in the jawbone to serve as an artificial root. After healing, a crown is attached to restore the visible tooth.

**What you can realistically expect**
- A stable, long-lasting result in most cases
- A natural appearance, though subtle differences from natural teeth may exist
- A process that requires patience—typically several months from start to finish

**What this option offers**
- High durability—often lasting decades with proper care
- No reliance on neighboring teeth
- Bone preservation in the treated area

**What this option requires**
- Surgical intervention and healing time
- Higher upfront investment
- Multiple appointments over several months

**Important to understand**
Implants have high success rates, but outcomes depend on individual factors like bone quality, overall health, and aftercare. Not every case is identical.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Adhesive (Maryland) Bridge

**What this involves**
A prosthetic tooth is bonded to the back of adjacent teeth using a thin metal or ceramic framework. No surgery is involved.

**What you can realistically expect**
- A faster result—often within weeks
- A good aesthetic outcome for most visible situations
- A solution that may need replacement after several years

**What this option offers**
- No surgical recovery
- Lower initial cost
- Simpler process overall

**What this option requires**
- Healthy adjacent teeth for support
- Acceptance that durability is more limited
- Potential for re-treatment over time

**Important to understand**
Bridges can provide excellent results, but they're not as permanent as implants. For some people, this trade-off is acceptable; for others, it may not align with their long-term expectations.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both options can lead to a comfortable, natural-looking result. However, "natural-looking" doesn't mean "identical to what was there before." Small differences in shade, contour, or feel may be noticeable to you, even if invisible to others.

Comfort during the process differs: implants require healing, while bridges require only a short adjustment period. Both lead to functional stability.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Implant + crown: typically 3–7 months, including healing
- Adhesive bridge: usually 2–4 weeks

These timelines are estimates. Your specific case may vary based on clinical factors.

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Single implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500
- Adhesive bridge: approximately €1,500 – €2,500

These are indicative ranges. Final costs depend on your situation, materials, and provider.

# Section 10: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Implant with crown**
- Recovery: 2–5 days of mild discomfort
- Daily life: Most activities resume quickly; some dietary adjustments during healing
- Long-term: Once healed, functions like a natural tooth

**Adhesive bridge**
- Recovery: None
- Daily life: Immediate return to normal
- Long-term: May require replacement in 5–10 years

# Section 11: Next Steps

To move forward with realistic expectations:

- Consider what matters most to you: longevity, simplicity, or cost
- Think about your comfort level with surgery and healing time
- Prepare questions for your dentist about success rates and potential complications
- Review the Smile-link decision guide for structured support

Making a good decision isn't about finding a perfect option—it's about finding the one that best fits your situation, values, and expectations.
