# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing one tooth in a visible area. Beyond the immediate aesthetic concern, this situation often raises deeper questions—about comfort, stability, and what you want for your smile in the years ahead.

# Section 3: Your Situation

A missing tooth in a prominent position tends to be noticed more than people expect—not just by others, but by yourself. Even when you've adjusted to it, there can be a lingering awareness, especially when smiling or speaking in certain situations.

But the experience goes beyond appearance. Many people find themselves thinking about function too: Will the bite remain balanced? Might neighboring teeth gradually shift? Is this something that will get more complicated over time? These aren't just practical questions—they often reflect a deeper desire for stability and predictability.

What's interesting about this scenario is how personal it is. Some people find the gap manageable; others feel it affects their confidence more than they anticipated. Both responses are valid, and understanding your own experience is the first step toward making a choice that fits.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For a single missing tooth in the aesthetic zone, there are typically two directions worth considering. Each has its own philosophy: one focuses on permanence and independence from other teeth; the other prioritizes speed and simplicity. The right choice depends on your values, your timeline, and how you think about long-term dental health.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Single Implant with Crown

**What this involves**
An implant—a titanium post—is placed in the jawbone where the tooth root once was. Over time, it integrates with the bone, and a custom crown is attached to restore the visible tooth.

**What you can expect**
A solution that becomes part of your mouth, functioning like a natural tooth and standing independently from the rest.

**The broader picture**
- It's designed for the long term—often decades
- Your neighboring teeth remain untouched
- Bone structure in the area is preserved
- The result tends to feel and look natural

**Worth reflecting on**
- It requires surgery and several months of healing
- The investment is higher upfront
- Not everyone wants to go through a multi-step process

**This approach often resonates with people who...**
Value permanence and are comfortable taking a longer path for a more integrated result.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Adhesive (Maryland) Bridge

**What this involves**
A replacement tooth is attached to the back of the adjacent teeth using a bonded framework, without requiring surgery or significant alteration to healthy teeth.

**What you can expect**
A relatively quick restoration that can provide a good aesthetic result with minimal intervention.

**The broader picture**
- The process is simpler and faster
- No surgery is involved
- It's often more affordable
- It preserves more of your natural tooth structure in the short term

**Worth reflecting on**
- It's not as permanent—it may need replacement over time
- There's a small risk of loosening
- It depends on the condition and position of adjacent teeth

**This approach often resonates with people who...**
Prefer a gentler first step, or who want more time before committing to a permanent solution.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both options can restore your smile in meaningful ways. The implant path offers a sense of permanence and integration; the bridge path offers speed and simplicity. Comfort is part of both—though the nature of that comfort differs. With an implant, there's initial healing; with a bridge, there's adjustment. Both lead to a stable outcome.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Implant + crown: typically 3–7 months
- Adhesive bridge: often achievable within a few weeks

The implant process includes healing time, which varies by individual. The bridge process is faster, with minimal recovery.

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Single implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500
- Adhesive bridge: approximately €1,500 – €2,500

These figures are guides, not commitments. Actual costs depend on your specific needs and the complexity of your case.

# Section 10: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Implant with crown**
- Recovery: 2–5 days
- Experience: possible mild discomfort and swelling
- Daily life: most activities resume quickly, with some adjustment to chewing

**Adhesive bridge**
- Recovery: none
- Experience: short adjustment period (1–2 days)
- Daily life: no significant disruption

# Section 11: Next Steps

This isn't a decision you need to rush. Taking time to reflect on what matters most to you—permanence, simplicity, cost, comfort—can help clarify the path forward.

When you're ready, consider:
- Writing down your questions and priorities
- Discussing your options with a dentist who listens
- Using the Smile-link decision guide to structure your thinking

The goal isn't just to fill a gap—it's to find a solution that feels right for you.
