# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing one tooth in a visible area, and we understand this can affect both how you feel about your smile and your sense of comfort. It's natural to think about appearance, stability, and what the future might hold.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When a tooth is missing somewhere visible—when you talk or smile—it's often noticed sooner than you'd expect. Even if you've grown used to it, it can still feel like something is missing. That sense of self-awareness is something many people experience more deeply than they anticipated.

Beyond appearance, there may also be questions running through your mind: Will chewing stay balanced? Might neighboring teeth start to shift? What will things look like in a few years? These questions are completely natural, and you're not alone in having them.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For a single missing tooth in a visible zone, there are generally two paths to consider. The right one for you depends on how permanent you'd like the solution to be, how you feel about involving the surrounding teeth, and what kind of timeline works for you.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Single Implant with Crown

**What this involves**
An implant replaces the root of the missing tooth, anchored securely in the jawbone. A crown is then placed on top to restore the visible tooth.

**What you can expect**
A stable, long-lasting solution that looks and feels natural—without affecting your other teeth.

**What others in your situation have valued**
- The security of knowing it's a lasting fix
- A natural appearance in the smile
- No impact on healthy neighboring teeth
- Helping maintain bone structure over time

**What to be aware of**
- It's a larger investment upfront
- The process takes several months
- Multiple appointments are involved

**This might feel right if...**
You're looking for something permanent and are comfortable with a slightly longer process in exchange for peace of mind.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Adhesive (Maryland) Bridge

**What this involves**
A replacement tooth is bonded to the back of the neighboring teeth using a minimal, non-invasive method.

**What you can expect**
A quicker, gentler solution that can restore your smile without surgery.

**What others in your situation have valued**
- A faster path to completion
- Less invasive—no implant surgery needed
- More affordable in many cases

**What to be aware of**
- It may need replacement over time
- There's a small risk of it loosening
- Not suitable for every situation

**This might feel right if...**
You'd like a simpler approach for now, or you're still weighing your options.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both paths can lead to a harmonious, confident smile. With an implant, the journey includes some healing time—but the result is deeply stable. With a bridge, you'll experience quicker results, though it may take a short while to adjust. Either way, comfort is central to the process.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Implant + crown: typically 3–7 months
- Adhesive bridge: often completed within a few weeks

After implant surgery, some mild discomfort is normal for a few days. With a bridge, there's generally no recovery needed.

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Single implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500
- Adhesive bridge: approximately €1,500 – €2,500

Final costs depend on your specific situation and the materials used. These figures are meant to help you plan, not to pressure you.

# Section 10: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Implant with crown**
- Recovery: 2–5 days
- You may experience: mild swelling or tenderness
- Daily life: most people return to normal activities quickly

**Adhesive bridge**
- Recovery: none required
- You may experience: brief adjustment (1–2 days)
- Daily life: no disruption expected

# Section 11: Next Steps

There's no rush to decide. When you're ready, it can help to:
- Reflect on what matters most to you
- Write down any questions you'd like to ask
- Discuss your options with a dental professional who understands your situation

The Smile-link decision guide is here to support you through that conversation—at your own pace.
