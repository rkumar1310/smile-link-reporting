# Section 2: Personal Summary

You are missing one tooth in a visible zone, which can be noticeable both aesthetically and functionally. Your attention goes not only to the appearance of your smile, but also to comfort, stability, and long-term confidence.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When one tooth is missing in a position that is visible when talking or smiling, this is often noticed more quickly than expected. Even if you have become accustomed to it yourself, others may continue to notice it. This makes this scenario more sensitive for many people than they initially anticipated.

Beyond the aesthetic aspect, uncertainty can also arise about function. You may wonder whether chewing will continue evenly, whether surrounding teeth will shift, and whether the situation will remain stable in the future. This combination of visibility and functional doubt plays an important role in how this scenario is experienced.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

When one tooth is missing in a visible zone, two functional-aesthetic directions are typically discussed. Which direction feels most logical for you depends on how definitive you want the solution to be, how important preservation of the adjacent teeth is to you, and what recovery time you find acceptable.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Single Implant with Crown

**What this involves**
An implant is placed in the jawbone to replace the missing tooth root. Subsequently, a crown is placed that mimics the visible part of the tooth.

**What you can expect**
A fixed solution that combines aesthetics and function, without relying on adjacent teeth for support.

**Advantages**
- Very stable and durable solution
- Natural appearance possible
- No burden on neighboring teeth
- Can contribute to preservation of bone structure

**Points to consider**
- Higher cost
- Healing period of several months
- Treatment proceeds in multiple steps

**This may be logical for you if...**
You are looking for a long-term, fixed solution and are willing to go through a slightly longer process for extra stability.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Adhesive (Maryland) Bridge

**What this involves**
A bridge where the missing tooth is replaced by an artificial tooth that is attached to the back of the neighboring teeth with a thin construction.

**What you can expect**
A faster and less invasive solution, without surgical intervention.

**Advantages**
- Shorter treatment time
- Usually lower or comparable cost
- No implantation needed
- Limited impact on daily life

**Points to consider**
- Less durable in the long term
- Chance of coming loose
- Not suitable for every situation

**This may be logical for you if...**
You are looking for a quick and less invasive solution, or do not yet want to make a definitive choice.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

With both options, the aim is a harmonious and natural result in the smile. Comfort during and after treatment plays an important role. With an implant, accounting for healing is essential; with a bridge, the emphasis is more on adjustment and stability.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Implant + crown: average 3-7 months
- Adhesive bridge: often achievable within a few weeks

After an implant, temporary mild discomfort may occur. With a bridge, there is usually no recovery time.

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Single implant with crown: approximately €2,200 - €2,500
- Adhesive bridge: approximately €1,500 - €2,500

The final cost depends on factors such as material choice, technical execution, and individual situation. Costs are part of the overall consideration, not an obligation.

# Section 10: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Implant with crown**
- Recovery time: 2-5 days
- Possible impact: discomfort and/or slight swelling
- Daily functioning: daily activities usually resumed within a few days; temporarily adjusted chewing

**Adhesive bridge**
- Recovery time: none
- Possible impact: short adjustment period (1-2 days)
- Daily functioning: no limitation

# Section 11: Next Steps

To make a well-prepared decision, it is advisable to:
- Clearly formulate your expectations and concerns
- Note questions about durability, comfort, and alternatives
- Discuss these options with a dentist
