# Section 2: Personal Summary

{{PATIENT_NAME}}, you have one missing tooth in {{TOOTH_ZONE}}, affecting both appearance and function. Your focus is {{PRIMARY_CONCERN}}.

# Section 3: Your Situation

{{TOOTH_ZONE_DESCRIPTION}} is visible during conversation and affects both aesthetics and chewing. Your surrounding teeth are stable, which means both treatment options are suitable for you.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

Two approaches exist for replacing your missing tooth. Both are routinely performed with documented outcomes. The choice depends on your priorities—your dentist will confirm clinical suitability during examination.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Single Implant with Crown

**What this involves**
A titanium post is placed into the jawbone. After healing (3-6 months), a custom crown attaches to it. The result functions like a natural tooth.

**Outcomes**
Studies show implants remain functional and stable in approximately 90-95% of cases over 10 years. Your individual outcome depends on bone quality, oral hygiene, and overall health—factors your dentist will assess.

**Benefits**
- Does not modify neighboring teeth
- Helps preserve bone structure
- No special maintenance once healed

**Considerations**
- Higher upfront cost
- Healing period of 3-6 months
- Multiple appointments required

**This option may suit you if:**
- You prioritize long-term durability
- Preserving healthy adjacent teeth is important
- Bone quality is adequate (dentist will assess)

# Section 6: Option 2 — Adhesive (Maryland) Bridge

**What this involves**
A replacement tooth bonds to the back of adjacent teeth. No surgical procedure is required.

**Outcomes**
Results are typically immediate and natural-looking. The appearance depends on the health and color of adjacent teeth, which your dentist will assess.

**Benefits**
- Shorter treatment time (2-4 weeks)
- Usually lower upfront cost
- No surgery required
- Minimal impact on daily life

**Considerations**
- May need replacement after 10-15 years
- Relies on adjacent teeth for support
- Not suitable for every case

**This option may suit you if:**
- You prefer a non-surgical approach
- A faster timeline is important
- Surgery is not possible or advised

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both options typically provide natural-looking, functional results. Success depends on bone quality, adjacent tooth health, and oral care—factors your dentist will assess.

**Trade-offs:**
- **Timeline:** Bridges take 2-4 weeks; implants take 3-6 months
- **Procedure type:** Bridges are non-surgical; implants require minor surgery
- **Adjacent teeth:** Bridges use them for support; implants are self-supporting
- **Typical lifespan:** Bridges last 10-15 years; implants last 15-25+ years

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

**Implant with crown:** 3-7 months total
- Initial placement: 1-2 hours
- Healing period: 3-6 months
- Crown placement: separate appointment

**Adhesive bridge:** 2-4 weeks
- Preparation and fitting over 2-3 appointments

Your dentist will provide a timeline specific to your situation after examination.

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Single implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500
- Adhesive bridge: approximately €1,500 – €2,500

Costs vary by location, materials, and complexity. Your dentist can provide a detailed estimate.

# Section 10: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Implant with crown**
- Recovery: 2-5 days of mild to moderate tenderness, managed with over-the-counter medication.
- Risks: Infection (2-5%), implant failure (5-10% over 10 years). Your individual risk depends on bone quality, oral hygiene, and health factors your dentist will assess.
- Daily life: Most people resume normal activities within a few days.
- Long-term: Standard dental care once healed.

**Adhesive bridge**
- Recovery: None required—adjustment period of 1-2 days.
- Daily life: No limitation.
- Long-term: Periodic check-ups recommended.
