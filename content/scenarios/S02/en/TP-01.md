# Section 2: Personal Summary

You are missing one tooth in a visible zone, affecting both appearance and function. Comfort and stability are relevant considerations.

# Section 3: Your Situation

A missing front tooth is visible during conversation and social interactions.

Beyond aesthetics, functional questions may include whether chewing will continue evenly, whether surrounding teeth will shift, and whether the situation will remain stable. Both visibility and function are relevant factors in this scenario.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

When one tooth is missing in a visible zone, two functional-aesthetic directions are typically discussed. Which direction feels most logical for you depends on how definitive you want the solution to be, how important preservation of the adjacent teeth is to you, and what recovery time you find acceptable.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Single Implant with Crown

**What this involves**
An implant is placed in the jawbone to replace the missing tooth root. Subsequently, a crown is placed that mimics the visible part of the tooth.

**What you can expect**
A fixed solution that combines aesthetics and function, without relying on adjacent teeth for support.

**Advantages**
- Population studies show average lifespans of 15-25+ years; individual outcomes vary significantly based on bone quality, healing capacity, and maintenance
- May achieve natural appearance in favorable cases; results depend on bone quality, gum health, material selection, and anatomical factors
- No modification of neighboring teeth required
- Can contribute to preservation of bone structure

**Points to consider**
- Higher cost
- Healing period of several months
- Treatment proceeds in multiple steps

**Factors that may be relevant when considering this option:**
- Long-term durability is a priority
- Preserving healthy adjacent teeth is important
- Bone quality is adequate (assessed by dentist)

# Section 6: Option 2 — Adhesive (Maryland) Bridge

**What this involves**
A bridge where the missing tooth is replaced by an artificial tooth that is attached to the back of the neighboring teeth with a thin construction.

**What you can expect**
A faster and less invasive solution, without surgical intervention.

**Advantages**
- Shorter treatment time
- Usually lower or comparable cost
- No implantation needed
- Limited impact on daily life

**Points to consider**
- Less durable in the long term
- Chance of coming loose
- Not suitable for every situation

**Factors that may be relevant when considering this option:**
- A faster, non-surgical approach is preferred
- A less invasive procedure is desired
- Surgery is not possible or advised due to medical factors

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

**Timeline vs. tooth preservation:**
Implants require 3-6 months healing but preserve adjacent teeth. Bridges complete in 2-4 weeks but require modifying neighboring teeth.

**Durability vs. invasiveness:**
Implants involve surgery but typically last longer (15-25+ years vs. 10-15 years for bridges). Bridges avoid surgery but may need replacement sooner.

**Cost vs. long-term value:**
Bridges have lower upfront cost. Implants cost more initially but may require fewer replacements over time.


# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Implant + crown: average 3-7 months
- Adhesive bridge: often achievable within a few weeks

Implant placement typically involves 3-7 days of swelling and discomfort, managed with medication. Bridge preparation may cause temporary sensitivity in adjacent teeth.

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Single implant with crown: approximately €2,200 - €2,500
- Adhesive bridge: approximately €1,500 - €2,500

*Cost estimates only. Actual costs vary based on complexity, materials, location, and individual case factors. Request a detailed quote from your dentist.*

# Section 10: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Implant with crown**
- Recovery time: 2-5 days for initial healing; full osseointegration takes 3-6 months
- Possible impact: swelling, discomfort, and temporary dietary restrictions
- Your individual risk profile may differ from population averages. Population studies show: infection (2-5%), implant failure (5-10% over 10 years), nerve damage (<1%), sinus complications (upper jaw only). Factors affecting your risk include bone quality, oral hygiene, smoking status, and medical conditions. Your dentist will assess these factors.
- Daily functioning: daily activities usually resumed within a few days; temporarily adjusted chewing

**Adhesive bridge**
- Recovery time: none
- Possible impact: short adjustment period (1-2 days)
- Daily functioning: no limitation

# Section 11: Next Steps

To make a well-prepared decision, it is advisable to:
- Clearly formulate your expectations and concerns
- Note questions about durability, comfort, and alternatives
- Discuss these options with a dentist

The Smile-link decision guide helps you to conduct this conversation in a structured and confident manner.
