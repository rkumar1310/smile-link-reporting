# Section 2: Personal Summary

{{PATIENT_NAME}}, you have one missing tooth in {{TOOTH_ZONE}}. Your focus is {{PRIMARY_CONCERN}}, and two proven treatment options exist for your situation.

# Section 3: Your Situation

{{TOOTH_ZONE_DESCRIPTION}} affects both function and appearance. Your surrounding teeth are healthy and stable, which means both treatment options are suitable for you.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

Two approaches can replace your missing tooth. Both are routinely performed with documented outcomes. The choice depends on your priorities—your dentist will confirm clinical suitability during examination.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Single Implant with Crown

**What this involves**
A titanium post is placed into the jawbone. After healing (3-6 months), a custom crown attaches to it. The result functions like a natural tooth.

**Outcomes**
Studies show implants remain functional and stable in approximately 90-95% of cases over 10 years. Your individual outcome depends on bone quality, oral hygiene, and overall health—factors your dentist will assess.

**Benefits**
- Does not affect neighboring teeth
- Helps preserve bone structure
- No special maintenance once healed

**Process**
- Healing takes 3-6 months
- Recovery involves 2-5 days of mild to moderate tenderness, managed with over-the-counter pain relief
- Most patients return to normal activities within a few days

**Characteristics:**
Long-lasting (typically 15-25+ years), self-supporting, independent of adjacent teeth.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Adhesive (Maryland) Bridge

**What this involves**
A replacement tooth bonds to the back of adjacent teeth. No surgical procedure is required.

**Outcomes**
Results are typically immediate and natural-looking. The appearance depends on the health and color of adjacent teeth, which your dentist will assess.

**Benefits**
- No surgery or recovery period
- Immediate results
- Proven technique for single-tooth replacement

**Considerations**
- May need replacement after 10-15 years
- Relies on adjacent teeth for support
- Suitability depends on adjacent tooth condition

**Characteristics:**
Non-surgical, faster completion, relies on adjacent teeth.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both options typically provide natural-looking, comfortable results. Success depends on bone quality, adjacent tooth health, and your oral care—factors your dentist will assess.

**Trade-offs:**
- **Timeline:** Bridges take 2-4 weeks; implants take 3-7 months
- **Procedure type:** Bridges are non-surgical; implants require minor surgery
- **Adjacent teeth:** Bridges use them for support; implants are self-supporting
- **Typical lifespan:** Bridges last 10-15 years; implants last 15-25+ years

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

**Implant with crown:** 3-7 months total
- Initial placement: 1-2 hours
- Healing period: 3-6 months
- Crown placement: separate appointment

**Adhesive bridge:** 2-4 weeks
- Preparation and fitting over 2-3 appointments

Your dentist will provide a timeline specific to your situation after examination.

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Single implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500
- Adhesive bridge: approximately €1,500 – €2,500

Costs vary by location, materials, and complexity. Your dentist can discuss what's included and payment options.

# Section 10: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Implant with crown**
- Recovery: 2-5 days of mild to moderate tenderness. Most people manage this with over-the-counter pain relief and return to normal activities quickly.
- Risks: Infection occurs in 2-5% of cases and can be treated with antibiotics. Implant failure occurs in approximately 5-10% of cases over 10 years. Your dentist will discuss your individual risk factors and prevention strategies.
- Long-term: Standard dental care once healed.

**Adhesive bridge**
- Recovery: None required—immediate return to normal activities.
- Long-term: Periodic check-ups recommended.
