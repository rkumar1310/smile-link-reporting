# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing one tooth in a visible area, and it's understandable if this feels like a bigger concern than others might realize. Both options available to you are well-established, predictable, and designed to restore your comfort and confidence.

# Section 3: Your Situation

A missing tooth in a visible spot can feel more significant than it might seem from the outside. You might notice it every time you smile or speak. That awareness is completely normal.

What's important to know is that this is a very common situation, and it's one that dental professionals handle regularly. The surrounding teeth are stable, and your mouth is capable of supporting a reliable solution. Nothing about your situation is unusual or cause for alarm.

Many people in your position have similar questions: Will chewing feel normal again? Will things stay stable? The answer, in most cases, is yes—both treatment options are designed to restore function and appearance in a predictable, controlled way.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

There are two main approaches for replacing a single missing tooth in a visible area. Both are routinely performed, well-understood, and have clear, documented outcomes. The choice between them depends on your personal preferences and how you'd like to approach the process.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Single Implant with Crown

**What this involves**
A small titanium post is placed into the jawbone in a routine procedure. Once healed, a custom crown is attached. The result is a fixed tooth that functions like your natural ones.

**What you can expect**
A stable, predictable result that becomes a permanent part of your mouth.

**Why this is considered reliable**
- Implants have high success rates (typically 90-95% over 10 years in population studies)
- They don't affect neighboring teeth
- They help preserve bone structure
- Once healed, they require no special maintenance

**What to know about the process**
- It takes a few months for full healing
- The procedure itself is straightforward
- Some mild discomfort is normal afterward, but manageable

**Key characteristics:**
Permanent, self-supporting, no impact on adjacent teeth.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Adhesive (Maryland) Bridge

**What this involves**
A replacement tooth is bonded to the back of the adjacent teeth. No placement procedure is required.

**What you can expect**
A simple, gentle way to restore your smile quickly.

**Why this is considered reliable**
- It's a proven technique for single-tooth replacement
- No recovery period needed
- Results are immediate and natural-looking

**What to know about the process**
- It may need to be replaced after several years
- It relies on the condition of adjacent teeth
- Not every case is suitable, but many are

**Key characteristics:**
Non-surgical, faster completion, relies on adjacent teeth for support.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both options can provide a natural-looking, comfortable result in most cases. The implant offers permanence and independence from other teeth; the bridge offers speed and non-surgical placement.

**Key trade-offs to consider:**
- **Time vs. longevity:** Implants take longer initially but typically last longer
- **Cost:** Higher upfront for implants, but bridges may need replacement after 10-15 years
- **Adjacent teeth:** Implants leave neighboring teeth untouched; bridges require their involvement
- **Procedure:** Implants involve a surgical phase; bridges do not

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Implant + crown: typically 3–7 months, though this varies based on healing
- Adhesive bridge: usually 2–4 weeks

Your dentist will provide a timeline specific to your case.

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Single implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500
- Adhesive bridge: approximately €1,500 – €2,500

These ranges are based on typical cases. Your dentist can provide a more precise estimate.

# Section 10: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Implant with crown**
- Recovery: typically 2–5 days of mild tenderness, though experiences vary
- Risks: infection (2-5%), implant failure (5-10% over 10 years) in population studies
- Daily life: Most people resume normal activities quickly
- Long-term: Once healed, standard dental care

**Adhesive bridge**
- Recovery: None required
- Daily life: Immediate return to normal
- Long-term: Periodic check-ups recommended

# Section 11: Next Steps

You don't need to decide right away. When you're ready, you can:

- Review this information again at your own pace
- Write down any questions you'd like answered
- Schedule a consultation with a dentist to discuss your specific case

Both options have helped many people in similar situations. Whatever you choose, you'll be in capable hands.

The Smile-link decision guide can help you prepare for that conversation with confidence.
