# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing one tooth in a visible zone. This affects both appearance and potentially function. There are options available, and the choice of what to do—or whether to do anything at all—is entirely yours.

# Section 3: Your Situation

A missing tooth in a visible area is often more noticeable than expected, both to yourself and to others. For some people, this is a significant concern; for others, it's something they've learned to live with.

You may have questions about whether surrounding teeth will shift, whether chewing will be affected, or what the long-term implications are. These are reasonable questions, and a dental professional can help you understand what applies to your specific case.

What matters here is what you want. Some people prefer to address the gap promptly; others prefer to wait, or to explore minimal interventions first. There is no single correct answer.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

There are two main approaches for replacing a single missing tooth in a visible area. The information below is meant to help you understand your options—not to guide you toward a particular choice.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Single Implant with Crown

**What this involves**
A titanium implant is placed in the jawbone as an artificial root. A crown is later attached to restore the visible tooth.

**What this offers you**
- A fixed, self-supporting solution
- Independence from neighboring teeth
- Long-term stability if healing is successful

**What to consider**
- Requires surgery and a healing period of several months
- Higher initial cost
- Multiple appointments involved

**You might choose this if...**
You prefer a permanent solution and are comfortable with the process involved.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Adhesive (Maryland) Bridge

**What this involves**
A replacement tooth is bonded to the back of adjacent teeth without surgery.

**What this offers you**
- A simpler, faster process
- No surgical recovery
- Lower initial investment

**What to consider**
- May need replacement over time
- Depends on the condition of adjacent teeth
- Less permanent than an implant

**You might choose this if...**
You want a less invasive option, or you're not ready for a permanent solution yet.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both options can provide a natural-looking result and restore function. The difference lies in how permanent each solution is and what the process involves. Comfort is achievable with either approach, though the path to get there differs.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Implant + crown: 3–7 months
- Adhesive bridge: typically a few weeks

You choose the timeline that works for your situation.

# Section 9: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Implant with crown**
- Recovery time: 2–5 days
- Possible impact: mild discomfort, slight swelling
- Daily functioning: most activities resume quickly

**Adhesive bridge**
- Recovery time: none
- Possible impact: brief adjustment (1–2 days)
- Daily functioning: no interruption

# Section 10: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Single implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500
- Adhesive bridge: approximately €1,500 – €2,500

These are ranges to help you plan. Specific costs depend on your situation.

# Section 11: Next Steps

**Your next steps are entirely up to you.** Here are some options to consider:

- Review this information at your own pace
- Prepare questions for a dental consultation
- Schedule an appointment when you feel ready
- Request additional information on specific topics

Remember, this is your decision. Take the time you need to make a choice that feels right for you. No one else can tell you what you should want or when you should act.
