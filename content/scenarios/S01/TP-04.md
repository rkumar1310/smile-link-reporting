# Section 2: Personal Summary

You've shared that the color of your teeth has been on your mind. That's completely understandable, and you're not alone in this. Your teeth are all present and healthy otherwise, which is a good starting point. There's no rush to make any decisions right now.

# Section 3: Your Situation

In this situation, your teeth are structurally in good condition. The color change happened gradually over time, which is a natural process that many people experience.

It's perfectly normal to feel uncertain about what, if anything, you might want to do. Many people in your position take their time to understand their options before making any choices. Whatever you decide, it should feel right for you.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

There are gentle approaches available for addressing tooth color. The goal is to give you information so you can think about what feels comfortable for you, at your own pace.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Professional Teeth Whitening

**What this involves**
A gentle treatment that can lighten the natural color of your teeth. This is done in a calm, controlled way, either in sessions or as a gradual process at home.

**What you can expect**
A subtle improvement in color while keeping your own natural teeth exactly as they are.

**What makes this approach gentle**
- Nothing is changed about your teeth permanently
- You can go slowly and see how you feel
- There's no procedure that requires healing
- You stay in control of the process

**Things to be aware of**
- Results develop over time
- Some people prefer to maintain results periodically
- Deeper discoloration may respond differently

**This might suit you if...**
You want to start with the gentlest possible option and see how it feels before considering anything further.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Veneers for Deeper Discoloration

**What this involves**
Thin, custom-made shells that are placed on the front of your teeth. They can provide a stable, lasting change in appearance.

**What you can expect**
A predictable result that doesn't require ongoing treatments.

**What makes this approach suitable**
- The result is stable once completed
- You won't need to think about it afterward
- Color and shape can be matched to look natural

**Things to be aware of**
- This is a more permanent change
- It's worth discussing with your dentist whether this is the right step for you
- Each tooth is treated individually

**This might suit you if...**
You've thought carefully about what you want and feel ready for a lasting solution.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both approaches focus on achieving a natural, comfortable result. The aim is never to create anything that feels unfamiliar or overwhelming. Your comfort during the process and satisfaction with the result are what matter most.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Whitening: can be done gradually over 1-2 weeks, or in a few calm sessions
- Veneers: completed in a few appointments, with time to adjust

There's no rush. Take whatever time feels right to feel ready.

# Section 9: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Option: Professional whitening**
- Recovery time: none
- You might notice: temporary mild sensitivity, which passes quickly
- Daily life: continues completely normally

**Option: Veneers**
- Recovery time: a day or two to get used to the feeling
- You might notice: slight awareness of the new surfaces initially
- Daily life: no restrictions

# Section 10: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Professional whitening: approximately €250 – €450
- Veneers: approximately €200 – €1,300 per tooth

These are general ranges to help you understand what's involved. Your dentist can provide specific information for your situation.
