# Section 2: Personal Summary

We understand that the color of your teeth is something that's been on your mind. It's completely natural to want your smile to feel fresh and reflect how you feel inside. Your teeth are all present and healthy, which gives you a solid foundation to explore your options.

# Section 3: Your Situation

In your situation, the structure of your teeth is sound, but the color has gradually shifted over time. Many people notice this change in photos or when looking in the mirror, and it can affect how confident you feel when you smile.

You're not alone in wondering what's possible and what approach might feel right for you. These are important questions, and it's good that you're taking the time to understand your options.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For discoloration without missing teeth, there are two main aesthetic directions to consider. The right choice depends on your personal preferences, your expectations for maintenance, and how long-lasting you'd like the results to be.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Professional Teeth Whitening

**What this involves**
A professional treatment that lightens your natural tooth color through one or more sessions.

**What you can expect**
A noticeable refreshing of your smile's color, while keeping your natural teeth intact.

**Advantages**
- You'll see results relatively quickly
- Your healthy teeth remain unchanged
- No healing time needed
- Can be a first step before other treatments if desired

**Points to consider**
- Results aren't permanent
- Some people prefer periodic touch-ups
- Very deep discoloration may respond differently

**This might be right for you if...**
You'd like to start with something gentle and reversible to see how much improvement is possible.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Veneers for Deeper Discoloration

**What this involves**
Custom-made thin shells placed on the front of your teeth to transform both color and appearance.

**What you can expect**
A stable, predictable result that doesn't require ongoing treatments.

**Advantages**
- Consistent, long-lasting color
- Precise control over color and shape
- Less maintenance over time

**Points to consider**
- This is a more permanent decision
- It's worth careful thought for healthy teeth
- Cost is higher per tooth

**This might be right for you if...**
You feel that whitening may not achieve what you're hoping for, or you prefer a more lasting solution.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both approaches aim for a natural-looking improvement that feels comfortable and authentic. The goal is to enhance your smile in a way that feels like you, not to create something artificial or overdone.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Whitening: typically 1-2 sessions or a 10-14 day home course
- Veneers: completed over multiple appointments, depending on how many teeth are involved

With whitening, you can resume normal activities immediately. With veneers, there may be a brief adjustment period.

# Section 9: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Option: Professional whitening**
- Recovery time: none
- What to expect: possible mild sensitivity for a day or two
- Daily life: no interruptions

**Option: Veneers**
- Recovery time: 1-2 days
- What to expect: slight sensitivity or awareness initially
- Daily life: you can resume activities right away

# Section 10: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Professional whitening: approximately €250 – €450
- Veneers: approximately €200 – €1,300 per tooth

The final cost depends on your specific situation. Your dentist can provide a clearer picture during your consultation.

# Section 11: Next Steps

When you're ready to move forward, consider:
- Reflecting on what matters most to you
- Noting any questions you'd like to ask
- Discussing your thoughts with a dental professional

We're here to support you in making a decision that feels right for you.
