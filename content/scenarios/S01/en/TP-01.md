# Section 2: Personal Summary

You are primarily concerned about the color of your teeth, while they are otherwise fully present and cause no functional issues. Your wish is focused on a natural refreshment, without your smile looking artificial.

# Section 3: Your Situation

In this scenario, your teeth are structurally sound, but the color has gradually changed. This is often noticeable in photos, in the mirror, or when you compare yourself to earlier times.

Although this causes no pain or discomfort, it can affect how freely you smile. Many people in this situation wonder whether a simple improvement is possible and how far they want to go.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For discoloration without missing teeth, two aesthetic directions are usually considered. Which direction feels most logical for you depends on your expectations, your sensitivity to maintenance, and the desired durability of the result.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Professional Teeth Whitening

**What this involves**
A controlled treatment that lightens the natural tooth color, through one or more sessions or through a short course.

**What you can expect**
A visible refreshment of the color, while preserving your own teeth.

**Advantages**
- Quick visible improvement
- No intervention on healthy teeth
- No recovery time
- Often combinable with other aesthetic steps

**Points of attention**
- The result is not permanent
- Periodic maintenance may be needed
- The effect is more limited with deep or internal discoloration

**For whom this makes sense**
For those who first want to see how much improvement is possible with a minimal, reversible step.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Veneers for Deeper Discoloration

**What this involves**
Thin shells (porcelain or composite) placed on the front of the teeth to correct color and appearance.

**What you can expect**
A stable and predictable aesthetic result that is less dependent on repetition.

**Advantages**
- Long-lasting color stability
- Precise matching of color and shape
- Less maintenance in the long term

**Points of attention**
- More definitive character
- Careful consideration needed for healthy teeth
- Higher cost per tooth

**For whom this makes sense**
For those who notice that whitening would be insufficient or consciously choose more peace and predictability in the long term.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

In both directions, the emphasis is on a natural-looking improvement. In this scenario, an exaggerated white or striking aesthetic result is usually not pursued. Comfort and a balanced appearance play an important role in the final choice.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Whitening: usually 1-2 sessions or a course of about 10-14 days
- Veneers: multiple steps, depending on the number of teeth and the chosen material

With whitening, there is no recovery time. With veneers, a short adjustment period may occur.

# Section 9: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Option: Professional whitening**
- Recovery time: none
- Possible impact: slight sensitivity for 24-48 hours
- Daily functioning: no restriction of work or social activities

**Option: Veneers**
- Recovery time: 1-2 days
- Possible impact: slight sensitivity or pressure sensitivity
- Daily functioning: immediate resumption possible

# Section 10: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Professional whitening: approximately €250 – €450
- Veneers: approximately €200 – €1,300 per tooth

The final cost depends on factors such as the number of teeth, the material, and the practitioner's approach. Costs are part of the overall consideration, not an obligation.

# Section 11: Next Steps

To make a well-prepared decision, it is useful to:
- Clarify your expectations and sensitivities
- Note questions about maintenance, durability, and alternatives
- Discuss this consideration with a dentist

In the Smile-link decision guides, you will find additional tools to approach this conversation in a structured way.
