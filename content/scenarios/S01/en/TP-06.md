# Section 2: Personal Summary

You've shared that tooth color is what you'd like to address. Your teeth are present and healthy, giving you flexibility in how you approach this. The choices here are yours to make.

# Section 3: Your Situation

Your teeth are structurally sound; the change you've noticed is in their color over time. This is a common occurrence and there are options available if you choose to explore them.

What matters is what you want. Some people are content with gradual changes; others prefer more definitive solutions. There's no single right answer.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

There are two main approaches for addressing tooth color. Here's the information to help you decide which, if either, aligns with what you're looking for.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Professional Teeth Whitening

**What this involves**
A professional treatment that lightens your natural tooth color.

**What this offers you**
- A non-permanent, reversible approach
- Control over how far you go
- The option to try before committing to anything more

**What to consider**
- Results may need maintenance
- Deeper discoloration may respond less
- You decide when and if to continue

**You might choose this if...**
You want to start conservatively and retain flexibility.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Veneers for Deeper Discoloration

**What this involves**
Custom shells that provide a new front surface to your teeth.

**What this offers you**
- A stable, lasting result
- Control over the final appearance
- Freedom from ongoing treatments

**What to consider**
- This is a more permanent choice
- It involves a higher commitment
- The result should be what you want, not what anyone else expects

**You might choose this if...**
You've decided you want a lasting change and you're ready to commit.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both options can provide improvement. What matters is whether the result matches what you're seeking. Your comfort with the process and satisfaction with the outcome are what count.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Whitening: 1-2 sessions or a home course of 10-14 days
- Veneers: completed over 2-4 weeks

You choose the pace that works for you.

# Section 9: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Professional whitening**
- No recovery needed
- Possible brief sensitivity
- No interruption to your life

**Veneers**
- 1-2 days adjustment
- Mild awareness initially
- Normal activities can continue

# Section 10: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Veneers: approximately €200 – €1,300 per tooth

These are ranges to help you plan. Specific costs depend on your situation.

- Review this information at your own pace
- Prepare questions for a dental consultation

Remember, this is your journey. Take whatever time feels right to make decisions that work for you. No one else can tell you what you should want or when you should act.
