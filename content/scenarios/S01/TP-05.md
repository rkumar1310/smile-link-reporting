# Section 2: Personal Summary

You've indicated that the color of your teeth is your main concern. Your teeth are all present and healthy, so we're focused on aesthetic improvement. It's worth having realistic expectations about what different approaches can achieve.

# Section 3: Your Situation

In your situation, your teeth are structurally sound but have changed color over time. This is something many people experience, and there are options available to address it.

It's helpful to understand that results vary depending on the cause of discoloration, your natural tooth characteristics, and the approach chosen. Some changes are quite achievable; others may be more limited. Understanding this range helps set appropriate expectations.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For tooth discoloration, two main approaches exist. Each has different capabilities and limitations. Understanding what each can realistically achieve helps in choosing the right path.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Professional Teeth Whitening

**What this involves**
A professional treatment that uses bleaching agents to lighten tooth color.

**Realistic expectations**
- Most people see improvement of 2-8 shades
- Surface stains (from coffee, wine, etc.) respond well
- Internal or deep stains may show less improvement
- Results are not identical for everyone

**Advantages**
- Non-invasive approach
- Preserves natural tooth structure
- Can be a good starting point

**Limitations to be aware of**
- Results gradually fade over months to years
- Not all discoloration responds equally
- Very bright white results shown in media are often unrealistic or enhanced
- Sensitivity during treatment is common

**This works well when...**
You're looking for improvement, not perfection, and you're open to maintenance over time.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Veneers for Deeper Discoloration

**What this involves**
Custom shells placed over the front of your teeth, providing a new visible surface.

**Realistic expectations**
- Color and shade can be precisely controlled
- Results are consistent and stable
- The outcome depends on the skill of the dentist and lab
- Veneers look best when they complement your natural features

**Advantages**
- Predictable, stable color
- Can address multiple aesthetic concerns at once
- No ongoing whitening treatments

**Limitations to be aware of**
- This is a permanent change to your teeth
- Veneers aren't indestructible and may need replacement
- Overly white or uniform results can look unnatural
- Higher investment of time and money

**This works well when...**
Whitening isn't sufficient for your needs and you're prepared for a more permanent solution.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both approaches can provide meaningful improvement. The key is matching your expectations to what each approach can realistically deliver. Natural-looking results that suit your face and personality tend to provide the most satisfaction.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Whitening: 1-2 sessions or 10-14 days at home
- Veneers: 2-4 weeks across multiple appointments

Neither requires extended recovery, though veneers may take a few days to feel completely normal.

# Section 9: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Professional whitening**
- Recovery: none
- What's typical: temporary sensitivity
- Impact on life: minimal

**Veneers**
- Recovery: 1-2 days
- What's typical: brief adjustment period
- Impact on life: can resume normal activities immediately

# Section 10: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Professional whitening: approximately €250 – €450
- Veneers: approximately €200 – €1,300 per tooth

These are ranges. Your specific situation will determine actual costs. It's worth discussing this during your consultation.

# Section 11: Next Steps

To make a well-informed decision:
- Consider what level of change would satisfy you
- Be honest about your expectations
- Discuss realistic outcomes with a dental professional

Understanding what's achievable helps ensure you're satisfied with the results.
