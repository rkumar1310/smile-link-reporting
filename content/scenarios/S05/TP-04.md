# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing several teeth in different areas of your mouth. This is a situation dental professionals handle regularly, with well-established treatment approaches that provide reliable, predictable results.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When teeth are missing in multiple areas, it's natural to feel uncertain about what to do. The situation may seem complicated because there's more than one gap to consider.

What's reassuring is that this type of scenario is very common and well-understood. Dental professionals have developed clear, systematic approaches for addressing scattered tooth loss. Your mouth can absolutely support a stable, functional restoration.

Many people in your situation have found significant improvement in their comfort and confidence after treatment. The goal is to create a balanced bite that works reliably—something you won't have to think about day to day.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For multiple missing teeth in different areas, there are two main approaches. Both are proven, well-documented methods with predictable outcomes. The choice between them depends on your specific situation and preferences.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Multiple Implants with Crowns

**What this involves**
Each missing tooth is replaced with an implant and crown, treated zone by zone.

**What you can expect**
A comprehensive restoration that addresses each gap individually.

**Why this is considered reliable**
- Implants have an excellent track record
- Each restoration is independent
- The approach is highly customizable
- Results are long-lasting

**What to know about the process**
- Treatment is done in stages
- Each phase is manageable
- Recovery between phases is typically straightforward

**This is often chosen by people who...**
Want a thorough, systematic approach.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Bridge on Implants (per zone)

**What this involves**
Multiple missing teeth in a zone are replaced with a bridge on implants.

**What you can expect**
A streamlined approach that addresses areas efficiently.

**Why this is considered reliable**
- Bridges on implants are a proven solution
- Fewer procedures overall
- Results are stable and functional

**What to know about the process**
- Treatment is organized by zone
- Each phase is predictable
- Recovery is similar to individual implants

**This is often chosen by people who...**
Prefer a more consolidated approach.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both approaches lead to comfortable, reliable function. You'll be able to eat normally without constantly thinking about your teeth. The restoration is designed to feel natural and stable.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Multiple implants with crowns: typically 4–7 months
- Bridges on implants: similar timeframe

The process is spread out, allowing healing between phases.

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500 per tooth
- Bridge on implants: approximately €4,500 – €6,000 per zone

Your dentist can provide specific estimates for your case.

# Section 10: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

Recovery is mild and manageable:
- 2–5 days of light discomfort per phase
- Normal activities resume quickly
- Improvement is gradual but steady

# Section 11: Next Steps

There's no pressure to decide quickly. When you're ready:
