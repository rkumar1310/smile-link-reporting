# Section 2: Personal Summary

You are missing multiple teeth at different locations in the mouth. This primarily has a functional impact, with comfort, stability, and an even distribution of chewing forces being central concerns.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When two to four teeth are missing but not next to each other, an uneven loading of the dentition often results. Many people notice that they unconsciously avoid certain zones or that chewing feels less natural than before.

Because the missing teeth are scattered, there is rarely one clear problem zone. This makes the scenario more complex: each space has its own influence on comfort and stability. Some zones require more support than others, which leads to uncertainty about the best approach. The goal is usually not just filling the spaces, but restoring an even bite across the entire mouth.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For scattered tooth loss, the focus is usually on flexible, zone-oriented solutions. In this scenario, two functional directions are often considered. The choice depends on the number of missing teeth per zone, the desired durability, and how extensively you want to approach the treatment.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Multiple Implants with Crowns

**What this involves**
Per missing tooth, an implant is placed with a crown on top. This approach is repeated per zone where a tooth is missing.

**What you can expect**
Individual replacement per tooth, with a natural distribution of chewing forces.

**Advantages**
- Very flexible per zone
- Natural loading per tooth
- No reliance on surrounding teeth
- Well adaptable to different situations

**Points to consider**
- Multiple procedures needed
- Higher total cost
- Process may feel longer due to spreading

**This may be logical for you if...**
You want maximum natural function per tooth and are willing to follow a more extensive process for optimal distribution.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Bridge on Implants

**What this involves**
Multiple missing teeth are replaced per zone by a bridge supported by two implants.

**What you can expect**
A structural solution per zone, where multiple teeth are restored together.

**Advantages**
- Fewer implants needed
- Clear, manageable approach
- Strong functional stability per zone

**Points to consider**
- Less individual per tooth
- Less flexible for later adjustments
- Requires sufficient bone volume per zone

**This may be logical for you if...**
You are looking for a practical and structured solution with a clear balance between stability and treatment complexity.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

In both directions, the emphasis is on functional restoration and comfort. The goal is that you can chew again without thinking about it, with an even distribution of the load. Visibility usually plays a subordinate role; reliability in daily use is paramount.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Multiple implants with crowns: average 4-7 months
- Bridges on implants: comparable, depending on planning per zone

After surgical steps, some days of discomfort may occur. After that, you usually resume your daily activities quickly.

# Section 9: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Multiple implants with crowns**
- Recovery time: 2-5 days per surgical phase
- Possible impact: discomfort or sensitivity per zone
- Daily functioning: limited impact per phase; total recovery time spread over several weeks

**Bridges on implants per zone**
- Recovery time: comparable, often with fewer separate phases
- Possible impact: discomfort per treated zone
- Daily functioning: limited, spread impact

# Section 10: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Implant with crown: approximately €2,200 - €2,500 per tooth
- Bridge on implants: approximately €4,500 - €6,000 per zone

The final cost depends on the number of zones, material choice, and technical execution. Costs are part of the total functional consideration.

# Section 11: Next Steps

To make a well-prepared decision, it is advisable to examine together with a dentist which approach per zone best suits your comfort, expectations, and planning. The Smile-link decision guide helps you conduct this conversation in a structured and confident manner.
