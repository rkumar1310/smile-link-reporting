# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing several teeth in different areas of your mouth. Unlike a single gap or adjacent missing teeth, this scattered pattern creates a more complex situation—one that affects not just chewing, but the overall balance of your bite.

# Section 3: Your Situation

Scattered tooth loss is, in many ways, the most nuanced scenario to address. There's no single "problem area"—instead, multiple zones are affected, each with its own impact on function and comfort. The result is often a cumulative sense of imbalance rather than one obvious issue.

Many people in this situation have adapted over time. They've learned which foods to avoid, which side to favor, how to work around the gaps. These adaptations work, but they come at a cost: the bite becomes increasingly uneven, and the remaining teeth carry more than their share.

What's interesting about this scenario is that it often goes underaddressed. Because no single gap feels urgent, the overall picture can be overlooked. But the cumulative effect—on comfort, on stability, on how you experience eating—is significant.

The path forward typically involves zone-by-zone restoration, with a focus on rebalancing the entire system rather than just filling individual gaps.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For scattered tooth loss, two strategic approaches are commonly considered. They differ in philosophy: one treats each gap as an individual case; the other groups adjacent missing teeth together. The right approach depends on your anatomy, your priorities, and how you think about long-term dental health.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Multiple Implants with Crowns

**What this involves**
Each missing tooth is replaced with its own implant and crown, treated zone by zone.

**What you can expect**
Maximum flexibility and natural function—each replacement stands on its own.

**The broader picture**
- Each tooth functions independently
- Load distribution becomes natural again
- No dependence on remaining teeth
- Treatment can be staged over time

**Worth reflecting on**
- Multiple procedures are involved
- The process is more extensive
- Cost accumulates per tooth

**This approach often resonates with people who...**
Want the most comprehensive restoration and are willing to invest the time to achieve it.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Bridge on Implants (per zone)

**What this involves**
Multiple missing teeth in a zone are replaced with a bridge supported by implants.

**What you can expect**
A more efficient approach that restores groups of teeth together.

**The broader picture**
- Fewer implants are needed
- Treatment is more streamlined
- Functional stability is high

**Worth reflecting on**
- Less flexibility per individual tooth
- Requires adequate bone in each zone
- May be less adaptable if needs change later

**This approach often resonates with people who...**
Prefer a more practical, consolidated approach without sacrificing quality.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both approaches aim to restore balanced, comfortable function. The difference is in how that goal is achieved—individually or in groups. Either way, the endpoint is the same: a mouth that works as a cohesive whole.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Multiple implants with crowns: typically 4–7 months
- Bridges on implants: similar, depending on zone count

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500 per tooth
- Bridge on implants: approximately €4,500 – €6,000 per zone

# Section 10: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

Recovery is spread across multiple phases. Each phase involves a few days of mild discomfort, followed by normal activity. The total timeline depends on how many zones are treated.

# Section 11: Next Steps

This is a situation that benefits from thoughtful planning. Consider:
- Which zones affect your comfort most?
- How do you feel about a staged vs. consolidated approach?
- What questions do you want answered?
