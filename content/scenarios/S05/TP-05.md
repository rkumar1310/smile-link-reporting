# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing several teeth in different areas. Treatment can significantly improve function and comfort, but the scattered nature of the problem makes this a more complex case that requires careful planning and realistic expectations.

# Section 3: Your Situation

Scattered tooth loss creates unique challenges. Unlike a single gap or adjacent missing teeth, multiple independent spaces affect the bite in different ways simultaneously. The result is often a cumulative impact on chewing comfort that's greater than the sum of its parts.

You've likely developed adaptations—chewing patterns, food preferences, unconscious adjustments—that help you manage. These work, but they represent ongoing compromise rather than resolution.

The complexity of this situation also means there's no single "right" answer. Treatment involves decisions about which zones to prioritize, which approach to use, and how to stage the process. These decisions have trade-offs that are worth understanding clearly.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For scattered tooth loss, two approaches are commonly used. Each has distinct advantages and limitations. The choice depends on your priorities, anatomy, and how you weigh factors like cost, duration, and long-term flexibility.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Multiple Implants with Crowns

**What this involves**
Each missing tooth is replaced individually with an implant and crown.

**What you can realistically expect**
- Maximum flexibility and natural function per tooth
- A longer, more complex process
- Higher total cost

**What this option offers**
- Independent function for each replacement
- Ability to stage treatment over time
- No load on remaining natural teeth
- Adaptability if future work is needed

**What this option requires**
- Multiple surgical procedures
- Extended treatment timeline
- Significant financial investment

**Important to understand**
Results are generally excellent, but the process is involved. Not everyone wants or needs this level of individualized treatment.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Bridge on Implants (per zone)

**What this involves**
Multiple missing teeth in a zone are replaced with a bridge on implants.

**What you can realistically expect**
- Efficient restoration of multiple teeth at once
- Fewer procedures overall
- More moderate cost per zone

**What this option offers**
- Streamlined treatment
- Strong functional stability
- Clear, organized approach

**What this option requires**
- Adequate bone volume per zone
- Less flexibility for future modifications
- Acceptance of grouped rather than individual treatment

**Important to understand**
Bridges are highly functional but less adaptable. If one component has an issue later, the entire bridge may be affected.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both approaches restore functional chewing. The result will be significantly better than the current situation, though neither perfectly replicates natural teeth. There's typically an adjustment period as you get used to the restorations.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Multiple implants with crowns: typically 4–7 months
- Bridges on implants: similar, possibly fewer phases

These are estimates. Your case may vary based on healing and complexity.

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500 per tooth
- Bridge on implants: approximately €4,500 – €6,000 per zone

Total cost can be substantial for scattered cases. It's worth viewing this as a long-term investment.

# Section 10: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

- Recovery: 2–5 days per surgical phase
- Daily life: Limited impact, spread over time
- Total process: Several months

# Section 11: Next Steps

To make an informed decision:
- Consider which zones affect you most
- Think about your tolerance for complexity
- Prepare specific questions about trade-offs
- Use the Smile-link decision guide to organize your thinking

A good decision here requires balancing multiple factors—there's no single "best" answer for everyone.
