# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing several teeth in different areas of your mouth. There are treatment options available. What you choose to do, and how you prioritize different zones, is entirely your decision.

# Section 3: Your Situation

Scattered tooth loss affects chewing in multiple areas simultaneously. You may have adapted to this situation, or you may find it limiting. Both experiences are valid.

The complexity of multiple gaps means there's no single obvious solution. Treatment typically involves decisions about which areas to address and in what order. These are personal decisions that depend on your priorities.

A dental professional can help you understand the implications of different approaches, but the choice of what to pursue remains yours.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

Two approaches are commonly used for scattered tooth loss. The information below is meant to inform your thinking, not to recommend one path over another.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Multiple Implants with Crowns

**What this involves**
Each missing tooth is replaced individually with an implant and crown.

**What this offers you**
- Maximum flexibility
- Independent function per tooth
- Ability to stage treatment as you choose

**What to consider**
- Multiple procedures required
- Higher total cost
- Longer overall process

**You might choose this if...**
You want individualized treatment and can accommodate the time and cost involved.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Bridge on Implants (per zone)

**What this involves**
Multiple missing teeth in a zone are replaced with a bridge on implants.

**What this offers you**
- More efficient treatment per zone
- Fewer procedures overall
- Potentially lower cost

**What to consider**
- Less individual treatment per tooth
- Less flexible for future changes
- Requires adequate bone per zone

**You might choose this if...**
You prefer a more streamlined approach to restoring each area.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both approaches can restore functional chewing. The result will improve upon your current situation, though it will differ from natural teeth in some ways.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Multiple implants with crowns: 4–7 months
- Bridges on implants: similar timeframe

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500 per tooth
- Bridge on implants: approximately €4,500 – €6,000 per zone

These are ranges to help you plan.

# Section 10: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

- Recovery: 2–5 days per surgical phase
- Daily life: limited, spread impact over time

# Section 11: Next Steps

**Your next steps are entirely up to you.** Options include:

- Review this information at your own pace
- Consider which areas matter most to you
- Prepare questions for a dental consultation
- Schedule an appointment when ready
- Decide to wait and reconsider later

There is no external pressure to act on any timeline. This is your decision to make.
