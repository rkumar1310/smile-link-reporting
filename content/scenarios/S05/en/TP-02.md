# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing several teeth in different areas of your mouth. We understand this can make everyday eating feel more complicated than it should be. You deserve a solution that restores balance and comfort.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When teeth are missing in different spots, the experience is often frustrating in ways that are hard to explain. It's not just one gap—it's multiple areas that don't feel right. You might find yourself adjusting how you chew, avoiding certain sides, or noticing that something feels "off" without being able to pinpoint it exactly.

What makes this situation unique is its complexity. There's no single problem zone to focus on—instead, you're dealing with several areas, each affecting your comfort in its own way. That can make the path forward feel less clear.

But there are approaches designed specifically for this kind of situation, and together, we can find one that fits your needs.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For scattered tooth loss, treatment is usually approached zone by zone. There are two main strategies, and the right one depends on your priorities—whether you value flexibility, simplicity, or a balance of both.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Multiple Implants with Crowns

**What this involves**
Each missing tooth is replaced individually with an implant and crown, treated zone by zone.

**What you can expect**
A personalized approach that restores function exactly where it's needed.

**What others in your situation have valued**
- Natural, independent function for each tooth
- Flexibility to treat zones in stages
- No reliance on remaining teeth
- Long-term stability

**What to be aware of**
- The process involves multiple procedures
- The total cost is higher
- Treatment may feel spread out over time

**This might feel right if...**
You want each gap addressed individually for the most natural result.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Bridge on Implants (per zone)

**What this involves**
Multiple missing teeth in a zone are replaced with a bridge supported by implants.

**What you can expect**
A more streamlined approach that restores multiple teeth at once.

**What others in your situation have valued**
- Fewer implants overall
- A clear, organized treatment plan
- Strong functional stability

**What to be aware of**
- Less individual treatment per tooth
- May require good bone volume
- Less flexibility for future changes

**This might feel right if...**
You prefer a practical, efficient approach that addresses areas together.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both paths lead to the same goal: comfortable, reliable chewing without constant awareness of what's missing. You'll be able to eat normally again, with confidence in your bite.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Multiple implants with crowns: typically 4–7 months
- Bridges on implants: similar, depending on number of zones

The process is spread out, with healing time between steps.

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500 per tooth
- Bridge on implants: approximately €4,500 – €6,000 per zone

These figures help you plan. Your dentist can provide estimates specific to your case.

# Section 10: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Multiple implants with crowns**
- Recovery: 2–5 days per surgical phase
- Daily life: Limited impact, spread over time

**Bridges on implants**
- Recovery: Similar, often with fewer phases
- Daily life: Gradual return to normal

# Section 11: Next Steps

When you're ready, consider:
- Thinking about which areas bother you most
- Writing down your questions and concerns
- Scheduling a consultation to explore options together
