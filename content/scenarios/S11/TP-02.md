# Section 2: Personal Summary

Your teeth are all present, but you're bothered by their alignment or positioning. We understand this can affect how you feel about your smile—even when others might not notice. Your wish for a more harmonious appearance is completely valid.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When teeth are crooked or irregularly positioned, it often matters more to you than to anyone else. You might notice it in photos, in the mirror, or in certain moments when you smile. That self-awareness can be surprisingly persistent.

Many people have lived with slight misalignment for years, only to reach a point where it feels like something they want to address. The teeth themselves are healthy—it's really about wanting your smile to match how you see yourself.

The good news is that there are gentle, effective approaches to creating the harmony you're looking for.

# Section 4: Treatment Directions

For aesthetic misalignment without missing teeth, two approaches offer real improvement. One focuses on actually moving teeth; the other on visually correcting their appearance.
