# Section 2: Personal Summary

Your teeth are completely present, but you are bothered by misalignment or irregular positioning. Your wish is mainly aesthetic: a straighter, more harmonious whole, without it looking unnatural.

# Section 3: Your Situation

With misalignment without missing teeth, it's usually not about a functional problem, but about how your smile feels and looks. Often it's small shifts, rotations, or uneven lines that you notice in photos or in the mirror.

Many people live with this for years, until the feeling arises that the teeth "just don't quite fit." Sometimes that's aesthetically bothersome when smiling, sometimes it gives the idea that teeth are harder to clean. The doubt often lies in the question: can this be subtly corrected without drastic steps?

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For aesthetic misalignment without tooth loss, two directions are usually considered. They differ strongly in approach: one focuses on moving teeth, the other on shape correction. Which option is most logical depends on the nature of the misalignment and your expectations.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Aligners (Invisible Braces)

**What this involves**
A series of transparent aligners that gradually move the teeth according to a digital treatment plan.

**What you can expect**
A gradual correction of tooth position, where the teeth themselves are moved.

**Advantages**
- Invisible in daily life
- No fixed braces
- Digital planning in advance
- Preservation of natural teeth

**Points to consider**
- Treatment usually takes longer
- Discipline needed in wearing
- Result follows step by step

**This may be logical for you if...**
You want a structural correction and are willing to invest time in a gradual process.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Veneers for Shape or Position Problems

**What this involves**
Porcelain veneers are placed on the front of the teeth to visually correct shape, position, and symmetry.

**What you can expect**
A quick aesthetic improvement, where the teeth look straighter without moving them.

**Advantages**
- Shorter treatment
- Typically provides visible improvement quickly, though individual results vary
- Correction of shape and color possible
- Can affect smile harmony, though results depend on individual factors

**Points to consider**
- Interventions on healthy teeth require careful consideration
- More definitive character
- Cost per tooth

**This may be logical for you if...**
You mainly find the visual result important and don't want a long treatment.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both options may help achieve a straighter-looking smile, though outcomes vary by individual circumstances. With aligners, the emphasis is on natural correction; with veneers, on visual harmony. Comfort during treatment differs: aligners require adjustment and discipline, veneers require good preparation.

**Important outcome considerations:**
- Results depend on starting position, bone structure, and individual response
- Final appearance may differ from digital previews or expectations
- Some cases require refinement or adjustment after initial treatment

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Aligners: average 6-18 months
- Veneers: usually a few weeks, depending on number of teeth

# Section 9: Recovery & Risk Factors

**Aligners**
- Recovery time: none
- Adjustment: 3-7 days with each new aligner
- Risks: May require refinements if teeth don't track as planned. Some patients experience prolonged treatment times. Results depend on compliance with wearing schedule.

**Veneers**
- Recovery time: 1-2 days
- Possible impact: sensitivity that may persist
- Risks: Irreversible tooth preparation required. Potential for long-term sensitivity. Veneers may need replacement after 10-15 years. Color matching can be challenging.

# Section 10: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Aligners: approximately €2,000 - €4,000
- Porcelain veneers: approximately €900 - €1,300 per tooth

The final cost depends on the number of teeth, material choice, and planning. Costs are part of an aesthetic consideration, not a necessity.

# Section 11: Next Steps

To make a well-prepared decision, it is useful to discuss what you find most important: moving teeth or optimizing the final image. The Smile-link decision guide helps you approach this conversation in a structured manner and with realistic expectations.
