# Section 2: Personal Summary

Your teeth are completely present, but you are bothered by misalignment or irregular positioning. Your wish is mainly aesthetic: a straighter, more harmonious whole, without it looking unnatural.

# Section 3: Your Situation

With misalignment without missing teeth, it's usually not about a functional problem, but about how your smile feels and looks. Often it's small shifts, rotations, or uneven lines that you notice in photos or in the mirror.

Many people live with this for years, until the feeling arises that the teeth "just don't quite fit." Sometimes that's aesthetically bothersome when smiling, sometimes it gives the idea that teeth are harder to clean. The doubt often lies in the question: can this be subtly corrected without drastic steps?

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For aesthetic misalignment without tooth loss, two directions are usually considered. They differ strongly in approach: one focuses on moving teeth, the other on shape correction. Which option is most logical depends on the nature of the misalignment and your expectations.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Aligners (Invisible Braces)

**What this involves**
A series of transparent aligners that gradually move the teeth according to a digital treatment plan.

**What you can expect**
A gradual correction of tooth position, where the teeth themselves are moved.

**Advantages**
- Invisible in daily life
- No fixed braces
- Digital planning in advance
- Preservation of natural teeth

**Points to consider**
- Treatment usually takes longer
- Discipline needed in wearing
- Result follows step by step

**This may be logical for you if...**
You want a structural correction and are willing to invest time in a gradual process.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Veneers for Shape or Position Problems

**What this involves**
Porcelain veneers are placed on the front of the teeth to visually correct shape, position, and symmetry.

**What you can expect**
A quick aesthetic improvement, where the teeth look straighter without moving them.

**Advantages**
- Shorter treatment
- Immediately visible result
- Correction of shape and color possible
- Great influence on smile harmony

**Points to consider**
- Interventions on healthy teeth require careful consideration
- More definitive character
- Cost per tooth

**This may be logical for you if...**
You mainly find the visual result important and don't want a long treatment.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both options can lead to a straighter and more balanced-looking smile. With aligners, the emphasis is on natural correction; with veneers, on visual harmony. Comfort during the treatment differs: aligners require adjustment and discipline, veneers mainly good preparation.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Aligners: average 6-18 months
- Veneers: usually a few weeks, depending on number of teeth

# Section 9: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Aligners**
- Recovery time: none
- Possible impact: adjustment 3-7 days with each new aligner
- Daily functioning: no limitation

**Veneers**
- Recovery time: 1-2 days
- Possible impact: slight sensitivity
- Daily functioning: no work interruption

# Section 10: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Aligners: approximately €2,000 - €4,000
- Porcelain veneers: approximately €900 - €1,300 per tooth

The final cost depends on the number of teeth, material choice, and planning. Costs are part of an aesthetic consideration, not a necessity.

# Section 11: Next Steps

To make a well-prepared decision, it is useful to discuss what you find most important: moving teeth or optimizing the final image. The Smile-link decision guide helps you approach this conversation in a structured manner and with realistic expectations.
