# Section 2: Personal Summary

Your teeth are present but you're bothered by their alignment. This is a common concern that many people share. Treatment options exist, ranging from gradual repositioning with aligners to immediate visual correction with veneers. Each approach has its own characteristics, timelines, and considerations. Whether to pursue treatment is entirely your choice—there is no medical necessity here, only personal preference. The information in this report is meant to inform your decision, not influence it.

# Section 3: Your Situation

Misalignment is an aesthetic concern. Some people find it significant; others live with it comfortably. How much it matters is personal.

There is no medical necessity to treat alignment issues if you're not bothered by them. If you are, options exist. The choice of what to do is yours alone.
