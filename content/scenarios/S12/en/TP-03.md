# Section 2: Personal Summary

You are experiencing looseness of teeth and/or pain complaints. Your main goal is restoring comfort, security, and stability, so that eating and daily functioning become possible again without tension.

# Section 3: Your Situation

Loose or painful teeth often cause uncertainty, especially during chewing or daily activities like eating and brushing.

In this scenario, the focus is functional confidence rather than aesthetics. The question is: how to restore a stable, comfortable feeling? Because looseness and pain can have different causes, careful assessment is important.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For loose teeth or pain, the focus is usually on solutions that restore stability and function. Depending on how many teeth are still reliable and how the load is distributed, two functional directions are usually discussed. The choice depends on durability, comfort, and the desired predictability in the long term.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Implants as Replacement

**What this involves**
Teeth that can no longer be preserved are replaced by implants with crowns, possibly spread over different zones.

**What you can expect**
A fixed solution aimed at restoring stability and chewing function.

**Advantages**
- Restoration of functional security
- No reliance on possibly weakened teeth
- Durable solution per tooth or zone
- Reliable feeling when chewing

**Points to consider**
- Surgical procedure needed
- Treatment in multiple steps
- Higher cost

**This may be logical for you if...**
You are looking for a predictable and stable solution and are willing to follow a treatment for long-term comfort.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Bridges with Limited Remaining Teeth

**What this involves**
Multiple teeth are replaced together by a bridge that relies on implants or remaining stable elements.

**What you can expect**
A structured solution that addresses multiple problem zones at once.

**Advantages**
- Restoration of function over a larger area
- Fewer separate procedures
- Clear and manageable approach

**Points to consider**
- Less individual per tooth
- Requires sufficient stable support points
- Less flexible for later adjustments

**This may be logical for you if...**
You are looking for a practical and coherent solution with multiple involved teeth.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

The goal of both directions is that you can function securely and comfortably again. Pain and looseness should no longer determine your daily activities. The emphasis is on stability, reliability, and a feeling of calm during chewing and speaking.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Implant solutions: average 4-7 months
- Bridge solutions: comparable, depending on planning

After procedures, some days of discomfort or sensitivity may occur. After that, you usually resume your daily activities quickly.

# Section 9: Recovery & Risk Factors

**Implant or bridge solutions**
- Typical recovery time: 3-7 days, though individual experiences vary
- Possible impact: mild to moderate discomfort for 3-7 days, temporary sensitivity to temperature
- Risks: Individual risk varies. Population studies show implant failure rates of 5-10% over 10 years. Infection risk is 2-5%. Additional risks depend on medical history and bone quality.
- Daily functioning: Most resume normal activities within a week

# Section 10: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Implants with crowns: approximately €2,200 - €9,000, depending on number of teeth
- Bridges on implants: approximately €4,500 - €6,000

The final cost depends on the extent of treatment, material choice, and technical execution. Costs are part of a functional consideration, not an obligation.

# Section 11: Next Steps

Because pain or looseness always requires attention, it's important to discuss these signals with a dentist in a timely manner. The Smile-link decision guide helps you formulate your questions, expectations, and concerns clearly, so that you enter the conversation well prepared.
