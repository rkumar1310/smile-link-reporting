# Section 2: Personal Summary

Your teeth are healthy. You're considering cosmetic improvement. This is entirely elective—your choice.

# Section 3: Your Situation

Purely cosmetic treatment of healthy teeth is a personal decision. There is no medical need. Whether to pursue enhancement, and which type, is up to you.

Some people find cosmetic improvement valuable for confidence and satisfaction. Others are content as they are. Both perspectives are valid.

# Section 4: Treatment Options

Options include whitening, veneers, aligners, or combinations.

Each involves different levels of investment, permanence, and timeline. The choice depends on your preferences.

# Section 5-11: [Practical Information]

Standard cosmetic dental procedures.

**Your next steps are entirely up to you.** This is an aesthetic choice with no external urgency. Take whatever time feels right to decide—or to decide that you're happy as you are.
