# Section 2: Personal Summary

Your teeth are all present and healthy, but you're interested in purely cosmetic improvement. Your goal is to enhance your smile's appearance without any underlying functional issues to address.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When teeth are healthy and complete, cosmetic treatment is purely elective—chosen for personal satisfaction rather than medical need. This is about optimizing appearance, whether that means brightening color, improving symmetry, or refining shape.

Many people in this situation have specific aspects they'd like to change, or simply want their smile to look as good as possible. The absence of functional problems means you have full flexibility in what (and whether) to pursue.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For purely aesthetic improvement, several approaches are available depending on your goals.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Professional Whitening

**For:** Color improvement
**What you can expect:** Brighter, fresher appearance
**Investment level:** Low to moderate

# Section 6: Option 2 — Veneers

**For:** Shape, alignment appearance, color
**What you can expect:** Significant aesthetic transformation
**Investment level:** Higher, more permanent

# Section 7: Option 3 — Aligners

**For:** Actual alignment correction
**What you can expect:** Straighter teeth over time
**Investment level:** Moderate, longer timeline

# Section 8: Combination Approaches

Multiple treatments can be combined for comprehensive aesthetic improvement—for example, alignment followed by whitening.

# Section 9: Important Considerations

Because this is purely elective:
- There's no urgency to decide
- You can start with less invasive options
- Your preferences are the primary guide
- Cost and permanence should be carefully weighed
