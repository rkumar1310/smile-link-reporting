# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing multiple adjacent teeth. This has a significant functional impact—your bite feels different, and daily eating requires more attention than it should. The question now is how to restore stability in a way that fits your life.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When several teeth next to each other are gone, the effects compound. It's not just about one gap—it's about how the remaining teeth take on more than they were designed for. Many people notice they've changed how they chew, sometimes without realizing it, shifting the work to other areas of the mouth.

This compensation works, in a way. But it can create a subtle sense of fragility—a feeling that things aren't quite balanced, that more might go wrong. Even without pain, there's often an awareness that the bite isn't functioning as it should.

What makes this scenario distinct is that it's not easily addressed with simple solutions. The space is too large for a single-tooth fix, and removable options often fall short of the stability people want. This tends to push the conversation toward more structural approaches.

# Section 4: Treatment Direction

For multiple missing adjacent teeth, the standard approach is a fixed solution that doesn't rely on remaining natural teeth. The goal is to create an independent structure that handles chewing forces the way natural teeth would.

# Section 5: Treatment Option — Bridge on Implants

**What this involves**
Two implants are surgically placed in the jawbone. After healing, a bridge is attached, replacing all the missing teeth in that span.

**What you can expect**
A fixed restoration that functions as an integrated part of your mouth—stable, self-supporting, and designed for long-term use.

**The broader picture**
- This approach is designed for durability—often decades
- Chewing forces are distributed naturally
- Adjacent teeth remain untouched and unloaded
- Bone in the area is preserved

**Worth reflecting on**
- The process requires surgery and several months of healing
- It represents a significant investment
- It's a commitment to a particular path

**This approach often resonates with people who...**
Want to restore a sense of completeness—a bite that works the way it should, without ongoing compromise.

# Section 6: Expected Results & Comfort

The goal is restoration of normal function. You should be able to eat without thinking about it, without adjusting your approach, without wondering if things will hold. That sense of reliability is what most people are seeking.

Comfort after placement is generally high, though there's an adjustment period as you get used to the new structure.

# Section 7: Duration of the Process

- Bridge on implants: typically 3–7 months

Most of this is healing time. The surgical phase is followed by integration, then final placement.

# Section 8: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Bridge on implants**
- Recovery: 3–7 days
- Experience: discomfort and possible swelling post-surgery
- Daily life: gradual return to normal; full comfort after final restoration

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Bridge on implants: approximately €4,500 – €6,000

This is a substantial investment. It's worth viewing it in terms of long-term stability and quality of life, not just immediate cost.

# Section 10: Considerations for Your Decision

Some questions worth sitting with:
- How much does bite stability matter to you day-to-day?
- Are you prepared for a multi-month process?
- What would it mean to have this resolved?

# Section 11: Next Steps

There's no rush. When you're ready:
- Reflect on what matters most to you
- Prepare questions for your consultation
- Consider using the Smile-link decision guide to organize your thoughts

The goal isn't just to fill a gap—it's to restore a sense of balance.
