# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing multiple adjacent teeth. There is a treatment option available that can restore function and stability. What you choose to do is entirely your decision.

# Section 3: Your Situation

Multiple missing adjacent teeth affect chewing and may impact bite stability over time. You may have noticed changes in how you eat, or you may have adapted. Some people find the situation manageable; others want to address it.

Potential long-term considerations include shifting of neighboring teeth and gradual bone loss in the gap area, though these vary by individual. A dental professional can help you understand what applies to your case.

Whether and when to treat is your choice. There is no externally imposed timeline.

# Section 4: Treatment Direction

For this situation, the most commonly recommended option is a fixed bridge on implants. Other approaches exist but typically offer less stability. The information below is meant to inform your thinking, not to direct your choice.

# Section 5: Treatment Option — Bridge on Implants

**What this involves**
Two implants are placed in the jawbone. After healing, a bridge replaces all missing teeth in the area.

**What this offers you**
- A fixed, stable restoration
- Even distribution of chewing forces
- Independence from remaining natural teeth

**What to consider**
- Requires surgery and several months of healing
- Significant financial investment
- Multiple appointments involved

**You might choose this if...**
You want a permanent, structural solution and are prepared for the process involved.

# Section 6: Expected Results & Comfort

Treatment can restore stable chewing function. Results vary by individual, and some adjustment period is typical. The goal is a restoration that feels reliable and comfortable in daily use.

# Section 7: Duration of the Process

- Bridge on implants: 3–7 months

Most of this is healing time between steps.

# Section 8: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Bridge on implants**
- Recovery time: 3–7 days
- Possible impact: discomfort and swelling
- Daily functioning: gradual return to normal

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Bridge on implants: approximately €4,500 – €6,000

These are ranges to help you plan.

# Section 10: Considerations for Your Decision

Questions you might ask yourself:
- How important is restoring full chewing function to me?
- Am I comfortable with the time and cost involved?
- What do I want to know before deciding?

# Section 11: Next Steps

**Your next steps are entirely up to you.** Options include:

- Review this information at your own pace
- Prepare questions for a dental consultation
- Schedule an appointment when you feel ready
- Decide to wait and reconsider later

This is your decision to make. Take whatever time you need.
