# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing multiple adjacent teeth. Treatment can significantly improve your chewing function and comfort, though it's important to understand what the process involves and what outcomes are realistic.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When several teeth next to each other are missing, the functional impact is substantial. The bite becomes unbalanced, and the remaining teeth may take on more stress than they're designed for. Many people develop compensatory habits—chewing on one side, avoiding certain foods—that work but aren't ideal long-term.

There are also gradual changes to consider. Without support in the gap area, bone may slowly diminish, and neighboring teeth may shift over time. These processes happen gradually and aren't guaranteed, but they're part of the full picture.

What's clear is that this situation calls for a structural solution. Simple fixes don't provide the stability needed for a gap of this size.

# Section 4: Treatment Direction

For multiple missing adjacent teeth, the standard approach is a fixed bridge on implants. This is the most reliable way to restore function, though it requires a significant commitment in terms of time and cost.

# Section 5: Treatment Option — Bridge on Implants

**What this involves**
Two implants are placed in the jawbone. After healing, a bridge is attached that replaces all the missing teeth.

**What you can realistically expect**
- A stable, functional restoration in most cases
- Improved chewing ability compared to the current situation
- A process that takes several months from start to finish

**What this option offers**
- High durability—typically lasting many years
- Even distribution of chewing forces
- No dependence on adjacent teeth
- Bone preservation in the treated area

**What this option requires**
- Surgical intervention and healing time
- Significant financial investment
- Multiple appointments over several months
- Adequate bone volume (which can be addressed if insufficient)

**Important to understand**
Success rates are high, but no treatment is guaranteed. Outcomes depend on factors like bone quality, healing ability, and oral hygiene. Some people experience complications, though these are relatively rare.

# Section 6: Expected Results & Comfort

The goal is functional restoration—comfortable chewing that doesn't require constant adjustment. This is achievable for most people, though "comfortable" may still feel different from the original natural teeth. There's typically an adjustment period as you get used to the new structure.

# Section 7: Duration of the Process

- Bridge on implants: typically 3–7 months, including healing

This timeline can vary based on individual healing and any preparatory work needed.

# Section 8: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Bridge on implants**
- Recovery: 3–7 days of discomfort post-surgery
- Daily life: Gradual return to normal; dietary adjustments during healing
- Long-term: Functions like natural teeth once complete

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Bridge on implants: approximately €4,500 – €6,000

This is a substantial investment. It's worth considering as a long-term cost—spread over the expected lifespan of the restoration—rather than just an upfront expense.

# Section 10: Considerations for Your Decision

Before proceeding, consider:
- Is the timeline and commitment acceptable to you?
- What questions do you have about potential complications?
- How does the cost fit into your overall priorities?

# Section 11: Next Steps

To make an informed decision:
- Think carefully about your expectations
- Prepare specific questions for your consultation
- Ask about success rates, potential complications, and alternatives
- Use the Smile-link decision guide to organize your thinking

A good decision is one that's made with clear understanding of both benefits and limitations.
