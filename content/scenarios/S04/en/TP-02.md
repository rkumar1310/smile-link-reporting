# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing several teeth next to each other, and we understand how this can affect your daily comfort. You want to eat normally again—without worry or adjustment—and feel confident that your bite is stable.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When multiple adjacent teeth are gone, the change in how you chew is often more noticeable than people expect. You might find yourself favoring one side, or being careful with certain foods. That constant awareness can be tiring.

Many people in your situation describe a sense of imbalance—not just physically, but emotionally. There's uncertainty: will things stay stable? Will the remaining teeth be affected? These are natural concerns, and you're not alone in having them.

What matters is finding a solution that gives you back that sense of normalcy—where eating is just eating again.

# Section 4: Treatment Direction

For multiple missing teeth next to each other, the focus is typically on a solution that provides real structural support. Temporary or removable options often don't offer the stability that this situation needs.

# Section 5: Treatment Option — Bridge on Implants

**What this involves**
Two implants are placed in the jawbone to anchor a bridge that replaces all the missing teeth in that area. The result is a fixed restoration that functions like natural teeth.

**What you can expect**
A stable, reliable solution that spreads chewing forces evenly—without putting pressure on your remaining teeth.

**What others in your situation have valued**
- The security of a fixed solution
- Being able to eat without thinking about it
- No need to remove anything for cleaning
- The feeling that things are "complete" again

**What to be aware of**
- The process takes several months (mostly healing time)
- Surgery is involved
- The investment is significant

**This might feel right if...**
You want something permanent—a solution that lets you move on without looking back.

# Section 6: Expected Results & Comfort

The goal is that chewing becomes automatic again. You shouldn't have to think about it, adjust for it, or worry about it. After an initial adjustment period, most people find the result feels natural and reliable.

# Section 7: Duration of the Process

- Bridge on implants: typically 3–7 months

Most of that time is healing. After the surgical phase, some discomfort is normal for a few days.

# Section 8: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Bridge on implants**
- Recovery: 3–7 days
- You may experience: discomfort, mild swelling
- Daily life: most people resume normal activities within days; full comfort comes after the final bridge is placed

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Bridge on implants: approximately €4,500 – €6,000

This is a significant investment, but one that many people find worthwhile for the stability it provides.

# Section 10: Considerations for Your Decision

Before your consultation, it might help to reflect on:
- How much does stability in chewing matter to you?
- Are you comfortable with a longer process for a more lasting result?
- What questions do you want answered?
