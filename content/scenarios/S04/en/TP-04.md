# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing several teeth next to each other. This is a common situation that dentists handle regularly. The treatment approach for this type of case is well-established and predictable, with the goal of restoring comfortable, reliable chewing.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When multiple adjacent teeth are missing, chewing can feel different. You might notice that you favor one side of your mouth or that certain foods require more effort. This is a normal response to the changed situation.

This type of scenario has clear, proven solutions. Your remaining teeth are stable, and your mouth can support a reliable restoration.

With proper treatment, the situation typically stabilizes rather than worsening. The goal is to restore comfortable chewing function.

# Section 4: Treatment Direction

For multiple missing adjacent teeth, the standard approach is a fixed bridge supported by implants. This is a well-documented, highly successful method that has been refined over many years.

# Section 5: Treatment Option — Bridge on Implants

**What this involves**
Two implants are placed in the jawbone in a routine surgical procedure. After healing, a bridge is attached that replaces all the missing teeth in that area.

**What you can expect**
A stable, permanent restoration that functions like natural teeth.

**Why this is considered reliable**
- Implant-supported bridges have a long track record of success
- The procedure is performed routinely by dental specialists
- The outcome is predictable in most cases
- Once complete, the restoration requires only normal care

**What to know about the process**
- The surgical phase is straightforward
- Healing takes several months, but most of that is just waiting
- Some discomfort is normal afterward, but manageable
- The final result is stable and durable

**Factors that may be relevant when considering this option:**
- Long-term durability is a priority
- Preserving neighboring teeth is important
- Bone quality is adequate (assessed by dentist)

# Section 6: Trade-offs to Consider

**Timeline vs. permanence:**
Implant-supported bridges require 3-7 months for healing but provide a long-term solution (15-25+ years typical). Traditional bridges complete faster (2-4 weeks) but may need replacement sooner (10-15 years typical).

**Surgery vs. tooth modification:**
Implants require a surgical procedure but preserve neighboring teeth. Traditional bridges avoid surgery but require preparing adjacent teeth as anchors.

**Cost vs. longevity:**
Implants have higher upfront costs but fewer long-term replacements. Bridges cost less initially but may need replacement over time.

# Section 7: Duration of the Process

**Implant-supported bridge timeline:**
- Initial consultation and planning: 1-2 appointments
- Implant placement surgery: 1 appointment
- Healing/osseointegration: 3-6 months
- Impressions and bridge fabrication: 2-3 appointments
- Final placement and adjustments: 1-2 appointments
- Total: 3-7 months

**Traditional bridge timeline:**
- Tooth preparation and impressions: 1-2 appointments
- Bridge fabrication: 1-2 weeks
- Final placement: 1 appointment
- Total: 2-4 weeks

# Section 8: Recovery & Risk Factors

**Implant-supported bridge:**
- Recovery: 3-7 days of swelling and discomfort after surgery
- Daily life: Most resume normal activities within a few days
- Risks: Individual risk varies. Population studies show implant failure rates of 5-10% over 10 years, infection risk of 2-5%. Smoking affects healing and long-term success.

**Traditional bridge:**
- Recovery: Minimal, possible temporary sensitivity
- Daily life: No significant disruption
- Risks: Depends on health of supporting teeth. May need replacement after 10-15 years.

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Bridge on implants: approximately €4,500 – €6,000

Your dentist can provide a more precise estimate for your specific case.

# Section 10: Considerations for Your Decision

- Are you looking for a stable, fixed solution?
