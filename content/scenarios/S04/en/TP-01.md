# Section 2: Personal Summary

You are missing multiple teeth next to each other, which primarily has a functional impact. Your main goal is restoring a stable bite and comfortable chewing, with a solution that feels reliable in daily use.

# Section 3: Your Situation

When two to four teeth next to each other are missing, the way you chew often changes noticeably. The load becomes unevenly distributed, and many people notice they automatically start chewing on one side or avoiding certain foods.

Because the missing teeth are adjacent, it is harder for the dentition to spontaneously keep that space stable. Surrounding teeth may take on more load than intended, which can create uncertainty about the long term. Even when there is little pain, many people experience a feeling of instability or "emptiness" in the bite, especially during firm chewing.

# Section 4: Treatment Direction

When multiple adjacent teeth are missing, the focus is usually on a structural, fixed solution that redistributes chewing function and provides adequate support. In this scenario, there is one dominant treatment direction, because loose or temporary solutions often provide insufficient stability.

# Section 5: Treatment Option — Bridge on Implants

**What this involves**
Two implants are placed in the jawbone and serve as anchor points for a bridge that replaces the missing teeth. This restores chewing function without relying on natural teeth for support.

**What you can expect**
A fixed and stable solution that replaces multiple teeth at once and is designed to handle chewing forces evenly.

**Advantages**
- Restoration of chewing function over a larger area
- Stable and durable design
- No burden on adjacent natural teeth
- Suitable for multiple missing teeth next to each other

**Points to consider**
- Requires sufficient bone volume
- Treatment proceeds in multiple steps
- Higher cost than single-tooth solutions

**This may be logical for you if...**
You are looking for a structural and reliable restoration of the bite and are willing to follow a longer process for more stability in the long term.

# Section 6: Expected Results & Comfort

The goal of this solution is that you can chew evenly and without thinking again. The emphasis is on function and reliability, not visibility. Comfort during daily use and a stable feeling when biting are decisive here. After placement, a short adjustment period usually follows.

# Section 7: Duration of the Process

- Bridge on implants: average 3-7 months, depending on healing and planning

After the surgical phase, some days of discomfort may occur. After that, you usually resume your daily activities quickly.

# Section 8: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Bridge on implants**
- Recovery time: 3-7 days
- Possible impact: discomfort and/or swelling after surgical phase
- Daily functioning: daily activities often resumed within a few days; definitive comfort after bridge placement

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Bridge on implants: approximately €4,500 - €6,000

The final cost depends on factors such as the number of teeth, material choice, and technical execution. Costs are best viewed as part of a long-term consideration around comfort and stability.

# Section 10: Considerations for Your Decision

- Do you want a solution that stably supports multiple teeth at once?
- How important is a bite without relying on natural teeth?
- Are you willing to follow a somewhat longer process for a more durable result?

These questions help clarify your priorities before consultation with a dentist.

# Section 11: Next Steps

To make a well-prepared decision, it is advisable to note your chewing comfort, expectations, and questions, and discuss these with a dentist. The Smile-link decision guides help you approach this conversation in a structured and confident manner.
