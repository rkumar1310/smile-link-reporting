# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing one tooth in the back of your mouth—the chewing zone. The options available to you are described below. What you choose to do, if anything, is entirely your decision.

# Section 3: Your Situation

A missing back tooth primarily affects chewing. You may have noticed changes in how you eat, or you may have adapted without much difficulty.

There are potential long-term considerations—neighboring teeth may shift, bone may gradually diminish in the gap area—but these vary by individual and don't occur in every case. A dental professional can help you understand what applies to your specific case.

Some people want to address it promptly; others prefer to wait and see. There's no objectively correct timeline.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

There are two main approaches for replacing a single missing back tooth. The information below is meant to inform, not to guide you toward any particular choice.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Single Implant with Crown

**What this involves**
An implant is placed in the jawbone as an artificial root. A crown is later attached to restore function.

**What this offers you**
- A fixed, self-supporting solution
- Independence from neighboring teeth
- Long-term stability if healing is successful

**What to consider**
- Requires surgery and a healing period of several months
- Higher cost
- Multiple appointments involved

**You might choose this if...**
You prefer a long-term, fixed solution and are comfortable with the process involved.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Bridge

**What this involves**
A fixed bridge spans the gap, supported by the teeth on either side.

**What this offers you**
- A functional restoration without surgery
- Faster completion
- Lower initial cost

**What to consider**
- Relies on and may affect neighboring teeth
- May need replacement after some years
- Suitability depends on adjacent tooth condition

**You might choose this if...**
You prefer a simpler, faster approach or aren't ready for implant surgery.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both options are designed to restore comfortable chewing, though individual outcomes vary. The difference lies in permanence, process, and how they interact with the rest of your mouth.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Implant + crown: 3–7 months
- Bridge: typically a few weeks

You choose the pace that works for your situation.

# Section 9: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Implant with crown**
- Recovery time: typically 2–5 days (varies by individual)
- Possible impact: mild discomfort
- Daily functioning: gradual return to normal

**Bridge**
- Recovery time: minimal to none
- Possible impact: brief adjustment
- Daily functioning: no interruption

# Section 10: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

Costs vary by practice, location, and case complexity. These ranges are illustrative:

- Implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500
- Bridge: approximately €2,100 – €2,700

# Section 11: Next Steps

**Your next steps are entirely up to you.** Options include:

- Review this information at your own pace
- Prepare questions for a dental consultation
- Schedule an appointment when you feel ready
- Decide to wait and reconsider later

This is your decision. There's no pressure to act on any particular timeline.
