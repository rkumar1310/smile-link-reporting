# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing one tooth in the posterior chewing zone. Both treatment options can significantly improve your situation, though each comes with specific considerations. Understanding realistic expectations will help you make an informed choice.

# Section 3: Your Situation

A missing back tooth affects chewing function, even if it's not visible. You may have noticed changes in how you eat—favoring one side, avoiding certain foods, or feeling that the bite is slightly off. These adjustments often happen gradually and may feel manageable.

However, there are longer-term considerations worth knowing. Over time, neighboring teeth may shift slightly, and the bone in the gap area may gradually diminish. These changes don't occur in every case, and their impact varies by individual, but they're part of the full picture.

It's also worth noting that while treatment can restore function, it won't perfectly replicate the original tooth. The goal is a comfortable, functional result—not an exact replacement of what was there.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For a single missing back tooth, two approaches are commonly used. Each has strengths and limitations. The right choice depends on your priorities—longevity, speed, cost, or simplicity.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Single Implant with Crown

**What this involves**
A titanium post is surgically placed in the jawbone to serve as an artificial root. After healing, a crown is attached.

**What you can realistically expect**
- A stable, long-lasting result in most cases
- Full chewing function restoration
- A process that requires several months

**What this option offers**
- High durability—often decades with proper care
- Independence from neighboring teeth
- Bone preservation in the treated area

**What this option requires**
- Surgery and healing time
- Higher upfront cost
- Multiple appointments

**Important to understand**
Success rates are high, but outcomes depend on individual factors like bone quality and overall health. Some discomfort during healing is normal.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Bridge

**What this involves**
A fixed prosthesis spans the gap, anchored to the teeth on either side.

**What you can realistically expect**
- Faster results—often within weeks
- Good functional outcome
- A solution that may need replacement after 10-15 years

**What this option offers**
- No surgery
- Lower initial cost
- Proven, familiar approach

**What this option requires**
- Preparation of neighboring teeth
- Acceptance that lifespan is more limited
- Suitability of adjacent teeth for support

**Important to understand**
Bridges work well in many situations but rely on neighboring teeth, which may have implications if those teeth develop issues later.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both options restore chewing function effectively. "Effective" means comfortable and reliable—not identical to the original. You'll be able to eat normally, though there may be a brief adjustment period.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Implant + crown: typically 3–7 months
- Bridge: usually 2–4 weeks

These are estimates. Your specific case may vary.

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500
- Bridge: approximately €2,100 – €2,700

Final costs depend on your situation and provider.

# Section 10: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Implant with crown**
- Recovery: 2–5 days
- Daily life: Gradual return to normal chewing; some dietary adjustments initially

**Bridge**
- Recovery: None
- Daily life: Immediate return to normal

# Section 11: Next Steps

To make a well-informed decision:
- Consider what matters most: longevity vs. speed, cost vs. permanence
- Think about your comfort with surgery
- Prepare questions about success rates and what-if scenarios
- Use the Smile-link decision guide for structured preparation

A good decision is one that fits your situation and expectations—not necessarily the most expensive or the fastest option.
