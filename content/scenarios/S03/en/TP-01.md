# Section 2: Personal Summary

You are missing one tooth in the posterior chewing zone. This is primarily a functional concern: you want to chew comfortably again and have a stable feeling in your bite, without constantly having to account for the empty space.

# Section 3: Your Situation

A missing tooth in the back is usually less visible, but you often notice it when eating. Some people automatically chew more on one side, avoid hard foods, or experience that the pressure distribution no longer feels right. This can raise questions: will this remain stable, will surrounding teeth shift, or will the space become larger?

Even though the aesthetic aspect is smaller, the desire for a practical solution is often clear. For many people, it's important that the solution not only fills the gap but also provides confidence when chewing and with long-term use.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For a single missing tooth in the chewing zone, two functional directions are typically discussed. The choice depends on how definitively you want to address it, how much support you desire, and what balance you seek between treatment duration, intervention, and cost.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Single Implant with Crown

**What this involves**
An implant replaces the missing tooth root. A crown is then placed to restore the tooth function.

**What you can expect**
A fixed solution that stabilizes chewing function, without relying on neighboring teeth.

**Advantages**
- Functional restoration with natural pressure distribution
- Stable, durable solution
- No burden on adjacent teeth
- Can contribute to preservation of bone structure

**Points to consider**
- Surgery and healing are required
- Treatment in multiple steps
- Higher cost

**This may be logical for you if...**
You want a durable solution and accept a longer process for maximum stability.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Bridge

**What this involves**
A bridge fills the space with a fixed construction that restores chewing function.

**What you can expect**
A fixed replacement focused on function and efficiency, often with a shorter timeline than an implant process.

**Advantages**
- Functional replacement
- Often faster to complete
- Clear approach

**Points to consider**
- Dependent on execution and support points
- Not suitable for every situation
- Cost remains a factor

**This may be logical for you if...**
You primarily seek functional restoration and want a practical process within a budget consideration.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

In both directions, the goal is that you can chew normally again with a stable feeling. Comfort and reliability in daily use are more important than visibility. With an implant, healing is part of the process; with a bridge, the emphasis is on adjustment and loading.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Implant + crown: average 3-7 months
- Bridge: depending on approach, usually faster

After an implant, temporary mild discomfort may occur. With a bridge, there is usually no recovery time.

# Section 9: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Implant with crown**
- Recovery time: 2-5 days
- Possible impact: discomfort or sensitivity
- Daily functioning: normal chewing gradually within 1-2 weeks

**Bridge**
- Recovery time: none
- Possible impact: short adjustment
- Daily functioning: no limitation

# Section 10: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Implant with crown: €2,200 - €2,500
- Bridge: €2,100 - €2,700

The final cost depends on material, technical execution, and your situation. Costs are part of the consideration, not an obligation.

# Section 11: Next Steps

To make a well-prepared decision, it is useful to:
- Describe your chewing comfort and expectations
- Note questions about durability, maintenance, and alternatives
- Discuss this with a dentist
