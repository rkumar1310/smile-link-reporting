# Section 2: Personal Summary

You're missing one tooth in the back of your mouth—the chewing zone. While it may not be visible to others, we understand it can affect your daily comfort. You just want to eat normally again, without constantly being aware of that empty space.

# Section 3: Your Situation

A missing back tooth often goes unnoticed by others, but you feel it every day. Maybe you've started chewing more on one side, or you've become cautious with certain foods. That subtle shift in how you eat can be more tiring than people realize.

It's natural to wonder: Will this gap cause problems over time? Could the surrounding teeth shift? These are questions many people in your situation ask, and they're worth exploring with a professional.

What matters most is getting back to eating comfortably—without having to think about it.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

There are two main approaches for replacing a single back tooth. The right one for you depends on your priorities: how long-lasting you'd like the solution to be, how you feel about the process involved, and what fits your situation.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Single Implant with Crown

**What this involves**
An implant is placed in the jawbone to serve as an artificial root. Once healed, a crown is attached to restore full chewing function.

**What you can expect**
A stable, self-supporting solution that feels natural when eating.

**What others in your situation have valued**
- Restored confidence when chewing
- No impact on neighboring teeth
- Long-term stability
- Natural pressure distribution

**What to be aware of**
- The process takes several months
- It involves surgery and healing
- The cost is higher than alternatives

**This might feel right if...**
You want a permanent fix and are comfortable with a longer process.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Bridge

**What this involves**
A fixed bridge spans the gap, supported by the teeth on either side.

**What you can expect**
A functional restoration that's completed more quickly.

**What others in your situation have valued**
- Faster results
- Familiar, straightforward approach
- Good functional outcome

**What to be aware of**
- It relies on neighboring teeth for support
- Not suitable for every situation
- May have a limited lifespan compared to implants

**This might feel right if...**
You prefer a simpler process or aren't ready for implant surgery.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

Both options can restore comfortable chewing. The implant offers long-term independence; the bridge offers speed and simplicity. Either way, the goal is the same: getting back to eating without worry.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Implant + crown: typically 3–7 months
- Bridge: usually completed within a few weeks

After implant placement, mild discomfort is normal for a few days. Bridges generally require no recovery.

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Implant with crown: approximately €2,200 – €2,500
- Bridge: approximately €2,100 – €2,700

These figures are meant to help you plan, not to pressure you.

# Section 10: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Implant with crown**
- Recovery: 2–5 days
- You may experience: mild discomfort or sensitivity
- Daily life: normal eating resumes gradually

**Bridge**
- Recovery: none
- You may experience: brief adjustment
- Daily life: no disruption

# Section 11: Next Steps

When you're ready, it can help to:
- Think about what matters most to you
- Write down any questions for your dentist
- Take your time—there's no rush
