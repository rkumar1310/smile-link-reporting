# Section 2: Personal Summary

You have a young profile and are bothered by light discoloration of your teeth. Your wish is mainly for a fresher and brighter appearance, without your smile looking unnatural or being drastically changed.

# Section 3: Your Situation

In young people, discoloration is often not about serious color problems, but about subtle differences that become visible in photos, in bright light, or in comparison with others. Many people experience their teeth as "healthy, but not as fresh as they would like."

Because your teeth are fully present and cause no functional complaints, the threshold for invasive treatments is usually high. The doubt often lies in the question: can this be improved in a simple way, without permanent interventions? In this scenario, preservation of natural teeth is central.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For light discoloration in a young profile, two aesthetic directions are usually considered. The first focuses on refreshing the natural color, the second on correcting color and shape when a stronger effect is desired. Which option fits best depends on your expectations and how permanent you want the result to be.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Professional Teeth Whitening

**What this involves**
A controlled treatment that lightens the natural tooth color, via one or more sessions.

**What you can expect**
A visible but subtle refreshing of your smile, with preservation of your own teeth.

**Advantages**
- Quick improvement
- No intervention on healthy teeth
- No recovery time
- Safe and often well predictable result

**Points to consider**
- The effect is temporary
- Periodic repetition may be needed
- Not every discoloration responds the same

**This may be logical for you if...**
You mainly want a fresher appearance and are looking for a simple, reversible solution.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Veneers for Higher Aesthetic Expectations

**What this involves**
Thin shells in composite or porcelain are placed on the front of the teeth to correct color and appearance.

**What you can expect**
A more pronounced and lasting aesthetic result, where color and shape can be precisely matched.

**Advantages**
- More stable color result
- Possibility to improve shape and symmetry
- Great influence on the overall picture of the smile

**Points to consider**
- Interventions on healthy teeth require careful consideration
- More definitive character
- Cost per tooth

**This may be logical for you if...**
You notice that whitening would be insufficient or consciously choose a more permanent aesthetic correction.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

In this scenario, the emphasis is on a natural and subtle improvement. Excessively white or striking results are usually not pursued. Comfort and a balanced appearance play an important role in the final choice.

# Section 8: Duration of the Process

- Whitening: usually 1-2 sessions or a course of 10-14 days
- Veneers: usually a few weeks, depending on number of teeth

# Section 9: Cost Indication (Guide Prices)

- Professional whitening: approximately €250 - €450
- Veneers: approximately €200 - €1,300 per tooth (composite to porcelain)

# Section 10: Recovery Time & Impact on Daily Life

**Professional whitening**
- Recovery time: none
- Possible impact: light sensitivity for 24-48 hours
- Daily functioning: no limitation

**Veneers**
- Recovery time: 1-2 days
- Possible impact: light sensitivity
- Daily functioning: no work interruption

# Section 11: Next Steps

To make a well-prepared decision, it is useful to discuss what you find most important: natural refresh or a more permanent aesthetic correction. The Smile-link decision guide helps you approach this conversation in a structured manner.
