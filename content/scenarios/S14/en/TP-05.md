# Section 2: Personal Summary

You have an older profile with visible wear and discoloration. Your wish is for a refreshed appearance that looks natural for your age—not an artificial transformation, but a subtle enhancement that fits who you are.

# Section 3: Your Situation

Over time, teeth naturally change. Color can deepen, surfaces may show signs of wear, and the overall appearance may feel less vibrant than before. This is a normal part of aging, but it doesn't mean you have to accept a smile that no longer reflects how you feel.

Many people in your situation aren't looking for dramatic change—they want their teeth to look healthy, clean, and natural for their age. The goal is usually harmony and freshness, not perfection or artificial brightness.

# Section 4: Possible Treatment Directions

For age-related wear and discoloration, two approaches are typically considered. Both aim for natural-looking improvement that respects your facial features and age.

# Section 5: Option 1 — Professional Whitening with Realistic Expectations

**What this involves**
A professional treatment that lightens the natural color, taking into account the limitations of aged enamel.

**What you can expect**
A visible freshening of appearance, though results may be more moderate than in younger patients.

**Advantages**
- Non-invasive approach
- Natural-looking improvement
- Preserves tooth structure
- Reasonable cost

**Points to consider**
- Results may be less dramatic on aged enamel
- May need periodic maintenance
- Deep discoloration may respond less

**This may be logical for you if...**
You want gentle improvement without major intervention.

# Section 6: Option 2 — Crowns or Veneers for Restoration

**What this involves**
Worn or discolored teeth are restored with crowns or veneers that provide both structural support and aesthetic improvement.

**What you can expect**
A more comprehensive solution that addresses wear, color, and shape together.

**Advantages**
- Addresses multiple issues simultaneously
- More predictable color outcome
- Can restore lost tooth structure
- Long-lasting results

**Points to consider**
- More involved treatment
- Higher cost
- Requires careful planning

**This may be logical for you if...**
Your teeth show significant wear or you want more comprehensive restoration.

# Section 7: Expected Results & Comfort

The goal is a natural, age-appropriate result—teeth that look healthy and cared for, not artificially perfect. Comfort and authenticity are prioritized over dramatic transformation.
