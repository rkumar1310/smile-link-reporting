# Section 2: Personal Summary

Your smile has changed over the years, and that's completely natural. We understand you may want it to look more like how you remember it—fresh and vibrant—while still looking like you.

# Section 3: Your Situation

Time leaves its mark on everyone's teeth. Colors deepen, surfaces show wear, and the sparkle may feel diminished. This doesn't mean anything is wrong—it's simply part of life.

Many people in your situation feel there's a gap between how their smile looks and how they feel inside. You're not looking for a Hollywood transformation—just a version of your smile that feels healthy, natural, and true to who you are now.

# Section 4: Treatment Directions

Two approaches can help restore freshness while keeping things natural.

**Option 2 — Crowns or Veneers** address wear and color together, offering more comprehensive restoration.
