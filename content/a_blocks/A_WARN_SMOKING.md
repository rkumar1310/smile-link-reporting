# Note Regarding Smoking and Dental Treatment

You have indicated that you smoke. While this does not prevent treatment, it's important to know that smoking can affect certain dental procedures, particularly those involving implants.

**What you should know:**
- Smoking can slow healing and increase complication risk
- Some treatments may require modified approaches for smokers
- Your dental professional can discuss how smoking affects your specific options
- Reducing or quitting smoking can significantly improve treatment outcomes

This is information to consider, not a barrier to care. Many smokers successfully undergo dental treatment with proper planning.
