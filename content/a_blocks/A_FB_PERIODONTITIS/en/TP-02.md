# Important: Gum Disease Consideration

**Please discuss your gum health history with your dentist.**

Gum disease is more common than many people realize, and having it doesn't prevent dental treatment. It does mean some additional steps may be needed to ensure treatment success.

Your dentist will work with you to address any gum health issues alongside your other treatment needs.
