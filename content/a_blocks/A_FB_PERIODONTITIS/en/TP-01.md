# Important: Gum Disease Consideration

**Your gum disease history must be addressed as part of treatment planning.**

Periodontal disease affects the foundation that supports dental work. Before certain treatments can proceed, your gum health may need to be stabilized.

Your dentist will assess your current periodontal status and explain what steps may be needed before, during, or after treatment to ensure the best outcomes.
