# Note Regarding Medical History

You have indicated medical conditions or medications that may be relevant to dental treatment. This is important information for your dental team.

**What you should know:**
- Most medical conditions can be accommodated with proper planning
- Your dental professional needs to know your full medical history
- Some treatments may require coordination with your physician
- Certain medications may affect treatment timing or approach

This does not prevent treatment, but it does mean your dental professional will want to discuss your medical history in detail to ensure the safest possible approach.

*Please bring a list of your current medications and any relevant medical records to your dental consultation.*
