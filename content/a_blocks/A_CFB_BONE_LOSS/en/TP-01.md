# Conditional: Bone Loss Consideration

**Your bone loss affects treatment options and planning.**

The amount of bone available determines which treatments are suitable. Some options may require bone grafting or alternative approaches when bone is limited.

Your dentist will assess your bone situation and explain what options are available for your specific case.
