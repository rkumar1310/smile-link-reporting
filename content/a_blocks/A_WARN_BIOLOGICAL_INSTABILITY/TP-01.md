# Important Notice: Biological Stability Considerations

Your responses indicate factors that may affect biological stability in your mouth. This is important context for treatment planning.

**What this means:**
- Your dentist will assess the current stability of your oral condition
- Treatment planning may need to address stabilization first
- Some procedures may be phased to allow for assessment between stages
- Ongoing monitoring may be recommended

These factors don't prevent treatment, but they do influence the approach. Your dentist will explain how this applies to your specific situation.
