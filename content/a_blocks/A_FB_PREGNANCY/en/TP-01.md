# Important: Pregnancy Consideration

**Please discuss your pregnancy with your dentist before proceeding with treatment.**

During pregnancy, certain dental procedures are typically postponed or modified. Your dentist needs to know about your pregnancy to ensure any treatment is appropriate and safe for both you and your baby.

This is a standard precaution in dental care. Your dentist will explain which treatments, if any, can proceed during this time and which may be better scheduled for after your pregnancy.
