# Important: Pregnancy Consideration

**Your pregnancy is an important factor in treatment planning.**

There are established guidelines for dental care during pregnancy. Your dentist will follow these protocols to ensure any treatment provided is appropriate for your stage of pregnancy.

Generally, the second trimester is considered the safest time for elective dental procedures if needed. Your dentist will assess what's necessary now versus what can safely wait.
