# Important: Pregnancy Consideration

**Please make sure your dentist knows about your pregnancy.**

Pregnancy affects how dental care is approached. Many treatments can still be done safely, but timing and certain procedures may need to be adjusted. This is normal and ensures the best care for both you and your baby.

Your dentist will work with you to determine what can be done now and what might be better to wait for. You're not alone in navigating dental care during pregnancy—it's something dental professionals handle regularly.
