# Time-Sensitive Situation

Based on your responses, your situation may benefit from relatively prompt attention. While this is not necessarily an emergency, delaying evaluation could affect your options or outcomes.

**Recommended timeline:**
- Schedule a dental consultation within the coming weeks rather than months
- If symptoms change or worsen, seek care sooner

This report provides general guidance, but the timing of treatment should be discussed with a dental professional who understands your specific situation.
