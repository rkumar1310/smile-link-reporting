# Important: Smoking Consideration

**Please discuss your smoking habits with your dentist.**

Smoking significantly affects dental treatment outcomes, particularly procedures involving healing and implants. Your dentist needs this information to provide appropriate recommendations.

Treatment options and expectations may be adjusted based on smoking status. Your dentist can also provide information about how reducing or stopping smoking could improve treatment outcomes.
