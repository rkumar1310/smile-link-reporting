**Please be open with your dentist about your smoking habits.**

Many people who smoke receive dental treatment successfully. Being honest about your habits helps your dentist provide the most appropriate care and set realistic expectations.

Your dentist understands that changing smoking habits is challenging. The goal is to work with your situation while providing the best possible care.
