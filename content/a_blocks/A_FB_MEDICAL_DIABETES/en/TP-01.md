# Important: Medical Condition Consideration

**Please inform your dentist about your medical conditions, particularly diabetes.**

Medical conditions like diabetes can affect dental treatment planning and healing. Your dentist needs complete information about your health to provide safe and effective care.

This information helps your dentist choose appropriate treatment approaches and take any necessary precautions. Your dentist may also coordinate with your physician if needed.
