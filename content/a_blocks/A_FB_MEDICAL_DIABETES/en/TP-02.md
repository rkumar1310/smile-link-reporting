# Important: Medical Condition Consideration

**Please share information about your medical conditions with your dentist.**

Managing dental care alongside conditions like diabetes is something dental professionals do regularly. Being open about your health helps ensure you receive care that's right for your situation.

Your dentist will work with this information to provide treatment that accounts for your overall health needs. Good communication between you, your dentist, and your physician leads to the best outcomes.
