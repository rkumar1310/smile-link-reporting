# Important: Chronic Inflammation Consideration

**Please inform your dentist about ongoing inflammation in your mouth.**

Chronic inflammation can affect healing and treatment outcomes. Your dentist needs to understand the current state of inflammation to plan treatment appropriately.

Addressing inflammation may be a prerequisite for certain procedures. Your dentist will assess the situation and explain what steps may be needed.
