# Important: Chronic Inflammation Consideration

**Please share information about any ongoing inflammation with your dentist.**

Dealing with chronic inflammation can be challenging, but it doesn't prevent dental treatment. Your dentist can help manage this as part of your overall care.

Working together to address inflammation can improve treatment outcomes and your overall oral health.
