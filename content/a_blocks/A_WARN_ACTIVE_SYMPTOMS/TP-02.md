# Important Notice: Active Symptoms

We understand you're experiencing some pain or discomfort, and we want to make sure this is addressed appropriately.

**What this means for you:**
- Your symptoms should be evaluated by a dentist as a priority
- The discomfort you're feeling may indicate something that needs attention first
- Once any acute issues are addressed, we can focus on longer-term planning

Please don't worry—this is a common situation. Your dentist will assess what's happening and help you feel comfortable before discussing further treatment options.
