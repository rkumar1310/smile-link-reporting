# Section 3: Context

When a single tooth is missing, the surrounding teeth and opposing teeth can begin to shift over time. This affects both function and aesthetics.

The available treatment options depend on the condition of neighboring teeth, bone quality, and your overall oral health. Your dentist will assess these factors during examination.

Common considerations include: the location of the missing tooth, whether adjacent teeth have existing restorations, and the health of the underlying bone structure.
