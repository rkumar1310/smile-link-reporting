# Section 3: Context

A single missing tooth creates a space where surrounding teeth may shift over time. This can affect function and aesthetics, though the extent varies between individuals.

Several factors influence which treatment options might suit you: the condition of neighboring teeth, bone quality, and overall oral health. Your dentist can assess these factors.

Key considerations include tooth location, existing dental work on adjacent teeth, and bone health. Understanding these helps you make informed choices about your care.
