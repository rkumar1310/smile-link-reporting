# Section 3: Context

When a single tooth is missing, the mouth naturally adapts. Surrounding and opposing teeth may shift gradually, affecting function and appearance. This is a normal response that many people experience.

The treatment options depend on your specific situation: the condition of neighboring teeth, bone quality, and overall oral health. Your dentist will evaluate these factors during your examination to determine what works best for you.

The main considerations include: where the tooth is located, whether adjacent teeth have existing work, and the health of the bone in that area. These factors help guide stable, long-term solutions.
