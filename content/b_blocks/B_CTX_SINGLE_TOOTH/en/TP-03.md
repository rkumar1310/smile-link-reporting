# Section 3: Context

A single missing tooth creates a gap where neighboring and opposing teeth can gradually shift. This natural response affects both function and aesthetics over time.

The treatment possibilities depend on multiple factors: the health of adjacent teeth, bone quality in the area, and your overall oral condition. These elements will be evaluated during your dental examination.

Key considerations include the tooth's location, existing restorations on neighboring teeth, and the current state of the underlying bone structure.
