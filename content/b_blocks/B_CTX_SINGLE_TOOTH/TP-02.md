# Section 3: Context

We understand that losing even a single tooth can feel significant. The surrounding teeth and opposing teeth may gradually shift when a gap remains, which can affect both function and appearance.

The treatment options available to you depend on several factors: the condition of neighboring teeth, your bone quality, and your overall oral health. Your dentist will carefully assess these during your examination.

Important considerations include where the missing tooth is located, whether adjacent teeth already have restorations, and the health of the underlying bone.
