# Section 3: Context

A single missing tooth affects the balance of your mouth. Over time, neighboring and opposing teeth tend to shift into the gap. This influences both function and appearance.

Treatment options vary based on several factors. The condition of adjacent teeth, available bone, and your overall oral health all play roles. Some options may be more suitable than others depending on these factors.

Important considerations include: the location of the missing tooth, existing work on neighboring teeth, and bone structure. Your dentist will assess what applies to your situation.
