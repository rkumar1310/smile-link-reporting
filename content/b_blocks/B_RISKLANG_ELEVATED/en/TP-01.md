# Section 10: Risk Factors

Based on your responses, one or more factors have been identified that may affect treatment planning and outcomes. This is important information for your dentist.

Elevated risk factors do not prevent treatment but require additional consideration in planning. Your dentist will:
- Assess the specific impact on your situation
- Discuss risk mitigation strategies
- Potentially modify treatment approaches
- Plan for closer monitoring if needed

Factors that may help manage elevated risk:
- Excellent oral hygiene maintenance
- Strict adherence to pre- and post-treatment protocols
- Regular follow-up appointments
- Close coordination with any other healthcare providers

Discuss these factors openly with your dentist to ensure appropriate treatment planning.
