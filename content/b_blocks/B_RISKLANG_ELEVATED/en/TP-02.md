# Section 10: Risk Factors

Based on your responses, we've identified factors that your dentist should consider carefully when planning treatment. We want to be transparent about this.

Having elevated risk factors doesn't mean treatment isn't possible—it means your dentist will take extra care to plan appropriately. They will:
- Evaluate how these factors affect your specific situation
- Discuss ways to reduce potential risks
- Consider modifications to standard approaches if helpful
- Plan for additional follow-up when beneficial

There are things you can do to support good outcomes:
- Maintain excellent oral hygiene
- Follow all pre- and post-treatment instructions carefully
- Keep all your follow-up appointments
- Coordinate with your other healthcare providers if applicable

Please share these factors with your dentist so they can provide the best care for your situation.
