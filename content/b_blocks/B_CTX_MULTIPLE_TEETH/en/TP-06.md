# Section 3: Context

Multiple missing teeth affect your mouth in various ways. Remaining teeth may shift, bite relationships can change, and chewing function is typically affected. The impact depends on your individual situation.

Treatment approaches differ based on whether missing teeth are adjacent or distributed throughout your mouth. Understanding your specific pattern helps identify suitable options.

Key factors in treatment planning include: the number and location of gaps, condition of remaining teeth, bone quality, and overall oral health. Your dentist can explain how these factors apply to your case.
