# Section 3: Context

We understand that dealing with multiple missing teeth can feel overwhelming. The effects extend beyond the visible gaps—remaining teeth may shift, your bite can change, and chewing becomes more difficult.

The treatment approach depends on your specific pattern. Whether your missing teeth are adjacent or scattered throughout your mouth influences which solutions work best for you.

Your dentist will consider several factors: how many teeth are missing, their locations, the health of your remaining teeth, bone quality in affected areas, and your overall oral condition. This careful assessment helps create a treatment plan tailored to your needs.
