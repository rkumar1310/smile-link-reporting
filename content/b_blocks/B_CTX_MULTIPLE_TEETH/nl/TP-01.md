# Section 3: Context

When multiple teeth are missing, the impact on your mouth extends beyond the gaps themselves. Remaining teeth may shift, bite alignment can change, and chewing function is affected.

The treatment approach depends on whether the missing teeth are adjacent (next to each other) or dispersed throughout the mouth. Adjacent gaps may be addressed differently than scattered missing teeth.

Key factors include: the number and location of missing teeth, condition of remaining teeth, bone quality in affected areas, and your overall oral health. These elements guide the treatment planning process.
