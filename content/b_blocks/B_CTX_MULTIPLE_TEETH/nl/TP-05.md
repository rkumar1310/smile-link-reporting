# Section 3: Context

Multiple missing teeth have broader effects than single tooth loss. Remaining teeth can shift, bite alignment may change, and chewing efficiency is reduced. The extent of these changes varies between individuals.

Treatment planning depends on the pattern of tooth loss. Adjacent missing teeth are approached differently than scattered gaps. Some solutions may be more practical than others depending on your situation.

Important factors include: how many teeth are missing, their locations, the state of remaining teeth, bone quality, and overall oral health. Not all treatment options may be suitable for every case.
