# Section 3: Context

Multiple missing teeth create a more complex situation, but this is manageable with proper planning. The effects extend beyond the gaps—remaining teeth may gradually shift, your bite can change, and chewing function is affected.

Treatment planning considers whether your missing teeth are adjacent or dispersed. Each pattern has established approaches that have helped many patients achieve stable results.

Your dentist will assess several key factors: the number and location of missing teeth, condition of your remaining teeth, bone quality in affected areas, and your overall oral health. This comprehensive evaluation ensures a treatment plan suited to your situation.
