# Section 3: Context

Multiple missing teeth affect your mouth in interconnected ways. Beyond the gaps, remaining teeth tend to shift, bite relationships change, and function becomes compromised.

The treatment strategy varies based on the pattern of tooth loss. Adjacent missing teeth present different considerations than teeth missing in separate areas of the mouth.

Several factors guide the planning: the number and distribution of missing teeth, condition of remaining dentition, bone availability in affected regions, and overall oral health. Understanding these elements helps determine appropriate approaches.
