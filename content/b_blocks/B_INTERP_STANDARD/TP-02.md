# Section 4: Interpretation

Based on what you've shared, your situation can be addressed through well-established treatment approaches. The specific path forward depends on what your dentist finds during the examination.

We appreciate that you've shared your priorities—whether you're most concerned about appearance, function, comfort, or some combination. These preferences matter and help guide which options might work best for you.

The next step is meeting with your dentist, who can connect your goals with their clinical findings to create recommendations that fit your needs.
