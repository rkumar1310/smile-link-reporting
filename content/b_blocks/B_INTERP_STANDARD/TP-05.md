# Section 4: Interpretation

Your responses suggest a situation that may be addressed through standard treatment approaches, though clinical examination will determine specifics. Some options may be more feasible than others.

Your priorities—aesthetics, function, comfort, or balance—help guide direction. However, treatment possibilities also depend on clinical factors that can only be assessed in person.

The next step is professional evaluation. Your dentist can then explain which options are realistically suitable for your particular situation and what each might involve.
