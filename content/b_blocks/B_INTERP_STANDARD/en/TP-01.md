# Section 4: Interpretation

Based on your responses, your dental situation can be addressed through established treatment approaches. The specific recommendations will depend on findings from your clinical examination.

Your priorities—whether focused on aesthetics, function, comfort, or a combination—help guide the treatment direction. These preferences inform which options may be most suitable.

The next step is a professional assessment where your dentist can correlate your preferences with clinical findings to develop personalized recommendations.
