# Section 3: Context

Your dental situation involves multiple factors that your dentist will assess. The current state of your teeth, gums, and underlying bone all contribute to determining suitable treatment approaches.

Treatment planning considers both immediate concerns and long-term oral health. The goal is to address current issues while supporting the health of your remaining dentition.

Your dentist will conduct a thorough examination to understand all relevant factors before discussing options with you.
