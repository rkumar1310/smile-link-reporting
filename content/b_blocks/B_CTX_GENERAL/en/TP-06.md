# Section 3: Context

Your dental situation has several aspects that influence treatment possibilities. These include the current state of your teeth, gums, and underlying bone.

Treatment planning considers both immediate concerns and longer-term oral health. The approach aims to address current issues while supporting your remaining teeth.

Your dentist can explain how these factors apply to your specific case and discuss options that may be relevant to you.
