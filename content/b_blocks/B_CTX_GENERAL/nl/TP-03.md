# Section 3: Context

Your dental situation involves interconnected factors. The condition of teeth, gums, and bone structure all influence treatment considerations.

Effective treatment planning addresses both present concerns and future oral health. Current issues are managed while considering the long-term wellbeing of remaining teeth.

A comprehensive examination allows your dentist to assess all relevant aspects before presenting appropriate options for your consideration.
