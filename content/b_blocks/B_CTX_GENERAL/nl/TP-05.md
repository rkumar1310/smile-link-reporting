# Section 3: Context

Your dental situation involves several factors that require assessment. The condition of your teeth, gums, and bone all play roles in determining suitable treatment directions.

Treatment planning must consider both current needs and long-term implications. Some approaches may be more appropriate than others depending on your specific circumstances.

Your dentist will examine all relevant factors. This assessment is important because not every treatment option is suitable for every situation.
