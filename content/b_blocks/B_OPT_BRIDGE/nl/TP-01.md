# Section 5: Treatment Options

## Dental Bridge

A dental bridge replaces missing teeth by anchoring artificial teeth to the natural teeth on either side of the gap. The anchor teeth are prepared with crowns that support the replacement tooth (or teeth) between them.

**Key characteristics:**
- Fixed restoration (not removable)
- Restores function and appearance
- Faster completion than implants
- Does not require surgery

**Considerations:**
- Adjacent teeth must be prepared (reduced in size)
- Relies on health of anchor teeth
- May need replacement after 10-15 years
- Cleaning requires special techniques

Bridges may be suitable when adjacent teeth already have crowns or large fillings, or when implants are not an option.
