# Section 5: Treatment Options

## Dental Bridge

A dental bridge spans the gap from missing teeth by anchoring prosthetic teeth to prepared natural teeth on either side. The abutment teeth receive crowns that support the pontic (replacement tooth).

**Characteristics:**
- Fixed prosthesis
- Restores masticatory function and aesthetics
- Shorter treatment timeline than implant therapy
- Non-surgical procedure

**Considerations:**
- Abutment teeth require preparation
- Long-term success depends on abutment tooth health
- Expected lifespan of 10-15 years
- Specific hygiene protocols required

Bridges are particularly indicated when abutment teeth are already compromised or when implant placement is contraindicated.
