# Section 5: Treatment Options

## Dental Bridge

A dental bridge replaces missing teeth by anchoring to the natural teeth on either side. These anchor teeth are prepared with crowns that support the replacement tooth between them.

**Potential benefits:**
- Fixed restoration
- Restores function and appearance
- Faster than implant treatment
- Non-surgical

**Important considerations:**
- Adjacent teeth must be prepared, which involves removing tooth structure
- The bridge is only as durable as the anchor teeth
- Bridges typically need replacement after 10-15 years
- Proper cleaning is essential but requires specific techniques
- If an anchor tooth fails, the entire bridge may need replacement

Bridges may be appropriate in some situations, particularly when anchor teeth already have significant restorations. Your dentist will assess suitability.
