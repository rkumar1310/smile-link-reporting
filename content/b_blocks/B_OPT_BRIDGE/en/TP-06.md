## Dental Bridge

A dental bridge replaces missing teeth by connecting artificial teeth to the natural teeth on either side of the gap. The supporting teeth are prepared with crowns that hold the replacement in place.

**Key aspects:**
- Fixed restoration—stays in your mouth
- Restores function and appearance
- Completed faster than implant treatment
- Does not require surgery

**Considerations:**
- Adjacent teeth need to be prepared
- Longevity depends on the health of supporting teeth
- May need replacement after 10-15 years
- Requires attention to cleaning around the bridge

Whether a bridge suits your needs depends on your specific situation. Your dentist can explain the pros and cons as they apply to you, and the decision about how to proceed is yours.
