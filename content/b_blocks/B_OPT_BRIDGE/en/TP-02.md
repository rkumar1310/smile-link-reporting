# Section 5: Treatment Options

## Dental Bridge

A dental bridge is a way to replace missing teeth by connecting artificial teeth to the natural teeth on either side of the gap. The neighboring teeth are fitted with crowns that hold the replacement tooth in place.

**What you should know:**
- It's a fixed restoration—you don't remove it
- Restores both function and appearance
- Treatment is typically completed faster than implants
- No surgery is required

**Things to consider:**
- The teeth on either side need to be prepared (shaped down)
- The bridge depends on the health of these anchor teeth
- Bridges typically last 10-15 years before potential replacement
- You'll need to learn specific cleaning techniques

A bridge can be a good choice when the adjacent teeth already have crowns or significant fillings, or when implants aren't suitable.
