## Dental Bridge

A dental bridge is a proven solution that has served patients well for decades. It replaces missing teeth by attaching artificial teeth to crowns placed on the natural teeth on either side of the gap.

**Why bridges work well:**
- They're fixed in place—no daily removal needed
- They restore both function and appearance effectively
- Treatment is completed more quickly than implants
- No surgical procedure is required

**Practical considerations:**
- The adjacent teeth are prepared to receive crowns
- Success depends on the health of these supporting teeth
- With proper care, bridges typically last 10-15 years
- Specific cleaning techniques keep the bridge healthy

Bridges are especially practical when neighboring teeth already have restorations or when implants aren't the right fit for your situation.
