# Section 6: Comparison

## Implant vs. Bridge

| Factor | Dental Implant | Dental Bridge |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Adjacent teeth** | Not involved | Used for support |
| **Bone health** | Maintained through use | May gradually decrease |
| **Procedure** | Surgical placement | Non-surgical |
| **Treatment time** | 3-6 months | 2-4 weeks |
| **Initial cost** | Higher upfront | More affordable initially |
| **Expected lifespan*** | Typically 15-25+ years | Typically 10-15 years |
| **Care routine** | Same as natural teeth | Special cleaning technique |

*Lifespans are population averages from studies. Your actual lifespan depends on bone quality, oral hygiene, and health factors. Individual outcomes vary.

Both implants and bridges are proven approaches. Here's what each offers:

**Implants may suit you if:**
- You prefer a self-supporting option
- Long-term durability is a priority
- You're comfortable with a surgical approach

**Bridges may suit you if:**
- You prefer a non-surgical approach
- You want faster results (2-4 weeks)
- A simpler process appeals to you

Your dentist will assess clinical factors; you decide which aligns with your priorities.
