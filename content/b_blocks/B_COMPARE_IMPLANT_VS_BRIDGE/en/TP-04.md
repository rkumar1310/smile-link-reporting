# Section 6: Comparison

## Implant vs. Bridge

Both options have helped many patients successfully. Here's how they compare:

| Factor | Dental Implant | Dental Bridge |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Adjacent teeth** | Stay healthy and intact | Prepared for crowns |
| **Bone health** | Maintained through use | May gradually decrease |
| **Procedure** | Placement procedure | Non-placement |
| **Treatment time** | 3-6 months | 2-4 weeks |
| **Initial cost** | Higher upfront | More affordable initially |
| **Expected lifespan** | Often 15-25+ years | Typically 10-15 years |
| **Care routine** | Same as natural teeth | Special cleaning technique |

**Implants are often chosen when:**
- Adjacent teeth are healthy and you want to keep them that way
- Bone is sufficient (your dentist can confirm)
- You value long-term durability

**Bridges are often chosen when:**
- Adjacent teeth already have restorations
- A non-placement approach is preferred
- A quicker timeline is important

Both are reliable—your dentist can guide you to what's most suitable.
