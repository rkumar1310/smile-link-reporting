# Section 6: Comparison

## Implant vs. Bridge

| Factor | Dental Implant | Dental Bridge |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Adjacent teeth** | Preserved | Require preparation |
| **Bone health** | Helps maintain bone | Does not prevent bone loss |
| **Procedure type** | Surgical | Non-surgical |
| **Treatment duration** | 3-6 months | 2-4 weeks |
| **Initial cost** | Higher | Lower |
| **Longevity** | 15-25+ years | 10-15 years |
| **Hygiene protocol** | Standard | Modified technique |

**Implants may suit you if:**
- Neighboring teeth are healthy
- Sufficient bone is present
- Long-term durability is a priority

**Bridges may suit you if:**
- Adjacent teeth already need work
- Surgery is not preferred
- Faster completion is important

Clinical assessment determines optimal selection based on individual factors.
