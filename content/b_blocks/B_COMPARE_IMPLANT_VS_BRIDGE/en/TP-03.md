## Implant vs. Bridge

| Factor | Dental Implant | Dental Bridge |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Adjacent teeth** | Preserved | Require preparation |
| **Bone maintenance** | Provides stimulation | No osteogenic effect |
| **Procedure type** | Surgical | Non-surgical |
| **Treatment duration** | 3-6 months | 2-4 weeks |
| **Initial cost** | Higher | Lower |
| **Longevity** | 15-25+ years | 10-15 years |
| **Hygiene protocol** | Standard | Modified technique |

**Implant indications:**
- Healthy adjacent dentition
- Adequate bone volume
- Prioritization of longevity

**Bridge indications:**
- Compromised adjacent teeth
- Surgical contraindications
- Time-sensitive requirements

Clinical assessment determines optimal selection based on individual factors.
