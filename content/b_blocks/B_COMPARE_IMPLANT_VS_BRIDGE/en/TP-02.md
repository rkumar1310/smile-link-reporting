# Section 6: Comparison

## Implant vs. Bridge

We understand that choosing between these options can feel complex. Here's a comparison to help:

| Factor | Dental Implant | Dental Bridge |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Adjacent teeth** | Remain untouched | Need to be prepared |
| **Bone health** | Helps maintain bone | Bone may gradually recede |
| **Procedure** | Involves surgery | No surgery needed |
| **Treatment time** | 3-6 months | 2-4 weeks |
| **Initial investment** | Higher | Lower |
| **Expected lifespan** | 15-25+ years | 10-15 years |
| **Daily care** | Like natural teeth | Requires special cleaning |

**An implant might work well if:**
- Your adjacent teeth are healthy
- You have adequate bone
- Long-term durability matters most to you

**A bridge might work well if:**
- Adjacent teeth already need crowns
- You prefer to avoid surgery
- You need a faster solution

Your dentist can help you understand which option aligns with your needs.
