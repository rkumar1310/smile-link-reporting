# Section 6: Comparison

## Implant vs. Bridge

| Factor | Dental Implant | Dental Bridge |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Adjacent teeth** | Not affected | Must be prepared |
| **Bone preservation** | Stimulates bone | Does not prevent bone loss |
| **Procedure** | Surgical | Non-surgical |
| **Treatment time** | 3-6 months | 2-4 weeks |
| **Initial cost** | Higher | Lower |
| **Expected lifespan*** | Typically 15-25+ years | Typically 10-15 years |
| **Maintenance** | Standard hygiene | Special cleaning required |

*Lifespans are population averages from studies. Your actual lifespan depends on bone quality, oral hygiene, and health factors. Individual outcomes vary.

Both implants and bridges are proven approaches. Here's what each offers:

**Implants may suit you if:**
- You prefer a self-supporting option
- Long-term durability is a priority
- You're comfortable with a surgical approach

**Bridges may suit you if:**
- You prefer a non-surgical approach
- You want faster results (2-4 weeks)
- A simpler process appeals to you

Your dentist will assess clinical factors; you decide which aligns with your priorities.
