# Section 6: Comparison

## Implant vs. Bridge

| Factor | Dental Implant | Dental Bridge |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Adjacent teeth** | Not affected | Must be prepared |
| **Bone preservation** | Stimulates bone | Does not prevent bone loss |
| **Procedure** | Surgical | Non-surgical |
| **Treatment time** | 3-6 months | 2-4 weeks |
| **Initial cost** | Higher | Lower |
| **Expected lifespan** | 15-25+ years | 10-15 years |
| **Maintenance** | Standard hygiene | Special cleaning required |

**When implants may be preferred:**
- Adjacent teeth are healthy
- Bone quality is adequate
- Long-term durability is prioritized

**When bridges may be preferred:**
- Adjacent teeth need crowns anyway
- Surgery is not desired or possible
- Faster completion is important

Your dentist will help determine which option suits your situation.
