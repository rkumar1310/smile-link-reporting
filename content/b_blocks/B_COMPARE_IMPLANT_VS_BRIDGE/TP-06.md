# Section 6: Comparison

## Implant vs. Bridge

Here's how these options compare across key factors:

| Factor | Dental Implant | Dental Bridge |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Adjacent teeth** | Not involved | Require preparation |
| **Bone health** | Helps maintain | Does not prevent loss |
| **Procedure** | Surgical | Non-surgical |
| **Treatment time** | 3-6 months | 2-4 weeks |
| **Initial cost** | Higher | Lower |
| **Typical lifespan** | 15-25+ years | 10-15 years |
| **Daily care** | Standard hygiene | Special techniques |

**Implants may suit you if:**
- Your adjacent teeth are healthy
- You have adequate bone
- Long-term durability is a priority

**Bridges may suit you if:**
- Adjacent teeth already need work
- You prefer to avoid surgery
- Faster completion matters

Your dentist can discuss how these factors apply to your situation. The choice is ultimately yours to make based on what matters most to you.
