# Section 6: Comparison

## Implant vs. Bridge

Each option has advantages and limitations:

| Factor | Dental Implant | Dental Bridge |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Adjacent teeth** | Unaffected | Must be prepared |
| **Bone** | May help preserve | Does not prevent loss |
| **Procedure** | Requires surgery | Non-surgical |
| **Treatment time** | 3-6 months | 2-4 weeks |
| **Cost** | Higher initial investment | Lower initial cost |
| **Lifespan** | Potentially 15-25+ years | Typically 10-15 years |
| **Maintenance** | Standard care | Modified cleaning needed |

**Implant considerations:**
- Not everyone is a candidate
- Requires adequate bone (may need grafting)
- Longer process but potentially longer result

**Bridge considerations:**
- Depends on anchor tooth health
- Faster completion
- May need replacement sooner

Neither option is universally better. The right choice depends on your specific situation, which your dentist can assess.
