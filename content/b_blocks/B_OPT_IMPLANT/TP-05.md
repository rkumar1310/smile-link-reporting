## Dental Implants

Dental implants involve placing a titanium post in the jawbone to function as an artificial root. After healing, a crown is attached. However, not everyone is a candidate.

**Potential benefits:**
- Can function similarly to natural teeth
- Adjacent teeth are not modified
- May provide long-term durability

**Important considerations:**
- Requires surgical procedure
- Higher initial cost
- Adequate bone is essential—some patients need bone grafting first
- Success is not guaranteed and depends on multiple factors
- Healing time varies; the process takes months

Your dentist will assess whether implants are realistic for your situation. Bone quality, overall health, and other factors determine suitability.
