## Dental Implants

A dental implant is a titanium post that's placed in your jawbone to serve as an artificial tooth root. Once healed, a natural-looking crown is attached. Many patients find implants feel very similar to their natural teeth.

**What you should know:**
- They function much like your own teeth
- Adjacent teeth remain untouched
- Adequate bone is needed for placement
- The complete process takes several months, allowing time for proper healing

**Things to consider:**
- It does involve a surgical procedure
- The initial investment is higher than some alternatives
- Success depends on bone quality and your oral health
- Care is similar to caring for natural teeth

Your dentist will help determine if implants are a good fit for you based on your specific situation.
