# Section 5: Treatment Options

## Dental Implants

Dental implants are a well-established solution. A titanium post is placed in the jawbone to serve as an artificial root. After the bone heals around it, a natural-looking crown is attached.

**What makes implants effective:**
- They function like your natural teeth
- They don't require modifying adjacent teeth
- Success rates are typically 90-95% over 10 years when bone quality is adequate, though individual results vary
- The treatment takes time but follows a predictable path

**Practical considerations:**
- A placement procedure is involved, though it's routine for experienced dentists
- The initial cost is higher, but durability often makes this worthwhile
- Success is linked to bone quality and oral health—both assessable factors
- Daily care is straightforward, like caring for natural teeth

Your dentist can evaluate whether implants are appropriate for your situation.
