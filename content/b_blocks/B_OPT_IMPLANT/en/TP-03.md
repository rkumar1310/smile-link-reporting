# Section 5: Treatment Options

## Dental Implants

Dental implants consist of a titanium post placed in the jawbone, functioning as an artificial root. A crown is attached after osseointegration (bone fusion) occurs.

**Characteristics:**
- Biomechanically similar to natural teeth
- Preserves integrity of adjacent teeth
- Requires sufficient bone volume
- Multi-phase treatment over several months

**Considerations:**
- Involves surgical intervention
- Higher initial investment
- Outcome depends on bone quality and systemic health
- Long-term maintenance parallels natural dentition

Clinical assessment determines implant candidacy based on anatomical and health factors.
