## Dental Implants

A dental implant is a titanium post surgically placed in the jawbone to serve as an artificial tooth root. After healing, a crown is attached to create a natural-looking replacement tooth.

**Key characteristics:**
- Functions like a natural tooth
- Does not affect adjacent teeth
- Requires adequate bone for placement
- Treatment spans several months (healing time varies)

**Considerations:**
- Requires surgical procedure
- Higher initial cost than some alternatives
- Success depends on bone quality and oral health
- Regular maintenance similar to natural teeth

Your dentist will assess whether implants are suitable based on your bone structure and overall health.
