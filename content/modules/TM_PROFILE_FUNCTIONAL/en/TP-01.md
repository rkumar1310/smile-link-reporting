# Function-Focused Approach

Based on your preferences, restoring proper function—being able to chew, bite, and speak comfortably—is a priority. This influences which treatment options may be most suitable for your needs.

Your dentist will discuss functional considerations for different options and explain how well each can restore normal use.
