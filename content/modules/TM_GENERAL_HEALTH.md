# General Health and Resilience

Your general health and resilience play a role in how intensive and comfortable a treatment trajectory can be. Many people notice that energy and recovery capacity can vary.

This influences tempo and planning of treatments. This does not mean that treatments are heavier, but rather that they are tailored to your capacity.

Always discuss this explicitly with your dentist.
