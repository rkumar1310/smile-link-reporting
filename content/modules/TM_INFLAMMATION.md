# Chronic Inflammation

Because there are signs of chronic inflammation, this plays a role in how treatments are planned. Many people experience recurring discomfort or problems that don't resolve on their own.

This influences how timing and predictability of results are considered. This does not mean that options are excluded, but rather that control and stabilization become important.

Always discuss this explicitly with your dentist, so that the approach can be carefully tailored.
