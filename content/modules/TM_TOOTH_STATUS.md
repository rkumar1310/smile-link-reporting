# Current Tooth Status

Your current tooth status, such as the number of present teeth and their condition, forms the basis for treatment considerations. Many people underestimate how small differences here can have impact.

This influences feasibility, complexity, and sequence of steps. This does not mean that options are fixed, but rather that context is important.

Always discuss your oral situation completely with your dentist.
