# Smoking and Dental Treatment

You've indicated that you smoke regularly. This is important information for treatment planning.

**How smoking affects dental treatment:**
- Healing after surgical procedures may take longer
- Risk of complications such as implant failure is somewhat elevated
- Blood flow to gums is reduced, which can affect recovery
- Long-term success rates may be slightly lower for certain procedures

**What this means for you:**
- Your dentist will factor this into the treatment plan
- Additional precautions may be recommended
- Follow-up care becomes more important
- Reducing or stopping smoking before and after treatment can improve outcomes

This doesn't prevent treatment, but it's a factor your dentist will consider when making recommendations and setting expectations.
