# Smoking Consideration

You've indicated regular smoking. This is clinically relevant.

**Key points:**
- Healing typically takes longer
- Implant success rates may be 10-20% lower than for non-smokers in population studies
- Your dentist will assess how this affects your options

**Recovery considerations:**
- Extended healing periods are common
- More frequent follow-up is typically recommended
- Individual outcomes vary significantly

Your dentist can discuss specific implications for your situation.
