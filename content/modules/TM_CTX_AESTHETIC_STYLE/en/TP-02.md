# Aesthetic Style Preferences

Your preferences about how your smile should look are important. Whether you prefer a natural appearance that matches your existing teeth or something different, these wishes can guide the treatment choices.

Your dentist will listen to your aesthetic preferences and show you how different options can achieve the look you want.
