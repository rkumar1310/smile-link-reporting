# Bone Loss Considerations

Because there are indications of bone loss, this plays a role in planning dental treatments. Many people are surprised that bone structure affects stability and complexity.

This influences how technique, preparation, and feasibility are considered. This does not mean that solutions are excluded, but rather that extra planning may be needed.

Always discuss this explicitly with your dentist, so that possibilities can be correctly assessed.
