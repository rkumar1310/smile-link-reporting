# Budget Considerations: Premium Options

You've indicated interest in premium options. Your dentist can discuss:
- Premium ceramic and porcelain material options
- Advanced techniques for color matching and translucency
- Digital smile design for treatment planning
- Master ceramist involvement for custom work
- How different materials affect longevity and stain resistance

Premium materials and techniques offer certain advantages, though all approaches have trade-offs. Your dentist can explain which options may be appropriate for your situation.
