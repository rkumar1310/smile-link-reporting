# Dental Anxiety

Because you have indicated experiencing fear or tension with dental treatments, this is an important point of attention. Many people postpone treatments due to tension, even when they know intervention is worthwhile.

This often influences tempo, explanation, and experience of the treatment process. This does not mean that treatments are heavier, but rather that comfort and calm may take center stage.

Always discuss your anxiety openly with your dentist, so that the approach can be tailored to what feels achievable for you.
