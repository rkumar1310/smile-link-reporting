# Bruxism (Teeth Grinding or Clenching)

Because you have indicated that you grind or clench your teeth, this is a relevant factor in dental treatments. Many people notice wear, tension, or damage without being aware of the underlying cause.

This influences how material choice, protection, and long-term durability are considered. This does not mean that aesthetic or functional solutions are less suitable, but rather that load is factored in.

Discuss this explicitly with your dentist, so that treatments can be properly aligned with your chewing load and expectations.
