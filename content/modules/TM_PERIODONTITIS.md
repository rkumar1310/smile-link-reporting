# Periodontal Issues

Because you have indicated periodontal problems, such as periodontitis or receded gums, this requires extra attention in treatment planning. Many people feel uncertainty about stability, even when there are few pain complaints.

This influences how sequence, maintenance, and long-term results are considered. This does not mean that further treatments are impossible, but rather that stability and preservation receive extra attention.

Always discuss this explicitly with your dentist, so that choices are realistic and well-founded.
