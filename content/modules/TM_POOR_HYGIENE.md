# Oral Hygiene Considerations

Because you have indicated that oral hygiene currently requires attention, this is an important factor in dental treatments. Many people notice that results are harder to maintain than expected.

This often influences how phasing and maintenance are considered. This does not mean that treatments don't make sense, but rather that basic care receives attention first.

Discuss this openly with your dentist, so that expectations remain clear and realistic.
