# Functional vs Aesthetic Priorities

The relationship between function and aesthetics varies depending on your specific situation. Some treatments excel in one area, while others balance both. Understanding these trade-offs helps with decision-making.

Your dentist will discuss how each option performs in terms of function and appearance, helping you see how different choices align with your priorities.
