# Treatment History

Your treatment history provides context for new choices. Many people carry previous experiences into their expectations and trust.

This influences how feasibility and planning are viewed. This does not mean that previous results are determinative for the future, but rather that they give direction.

Always openly discuss your treatment history with your dentist.
