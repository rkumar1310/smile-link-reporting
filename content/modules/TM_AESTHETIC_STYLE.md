# Aesthetic Style Preference

Because you have a clear aesthetic style preference, this plays an important role in cosmetic treatments. Many people notice that taste and appearance are strongly personal.

This influences how shape, color, and transparency are considered. This does not mean that one style is better than another, but rather that alignment is crucial.

Always explicitly discuss your preferences with your dentist, so that the result fits you.
