# Pregnancy Considerations

Your pregnancy is an important factor in planning any dental treatment. This is a well-understood situation, and your dentist has clear guidelines to follow.

Many treatments can proceed safely with appropriate timing. Some may be postponed until after delivery if not urgent. Your dentist will provide clear guidance on what's recommended for your specific situation and timeline.
