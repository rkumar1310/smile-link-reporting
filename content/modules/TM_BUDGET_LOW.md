# Budget-Conscious Approach

Because affordability plays an important role for you, it is logical that treatments are also viewed cost-consciously. Many people want overview and control over expenses.

This influences how phasing and priorities are considered. This does not mean that quality is unimportant, but rather that choices are carefully weighed.

Always openly discuss your budget expectations with your dentist.
