# Before We Begin

We understand that thinking about dental treatment can bring up difficult feelings. Many people share similar concerns, and those feelings are completely valid.

This report is not asking you to make any decisions right now. It's simply here to give you information at your own pace. You can read as much or as little as feels comfortable.

If at any point you feel overwhelmed:
- You can close this report and return to it later
- There's no timeline or pressure
- Your feelings are part of the conversation, not separate from it

When you're ready, we'll walk through your situation together—one small step at a time.
