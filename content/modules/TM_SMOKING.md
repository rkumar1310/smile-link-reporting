# Smoking or Vaping

Because you have indicated that you smoke or vape, this can affect how dental treatments and recovery are estimated. Many people underestimate the role that lifestyle habits play in healing and comfort after treatment.

This influences how aftercare, recovery period, and realistic expectations are considered. This does not mean that treatments are excluded, but rather that extra attention to follow-up is logical.

Always discuss this openly with your dentist, so that treatments can be carefully tailored to your situation.
