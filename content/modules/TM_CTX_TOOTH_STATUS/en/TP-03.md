# Current Tooth Status

Your current tooth status provides the foundation for treatment planning. The condition of remaining tooth structure, presence of previous dental work, and any damage or decay all influence what approaches are possible.

Your dentist will explain how your current situation connects to the available treatment options and their likely outcomes.
