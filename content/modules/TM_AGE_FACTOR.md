# Age Considerations

Because age was indicated, this may factor into how treatments are viewed. Many people wonder what remains realistic and comfortable in the longer term.

This influences expectations, recovery, and maintenance. This does not mean that age imposes limitations, but rather that it can give direction to choices.

Always discuss this with your dentist, so that options are considered carefully and personally.
